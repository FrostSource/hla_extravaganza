01_01155 "But …"  
01_01156 "…And you saved me?"  
01_01157 "Do we know where they're taking him?"  
01_01161 "Ready."  
01_01162 "Hm. Didn't work."  
01_01163 "Still not working."  
01_01164 "Uh uh."  
01_01165 "Nope."  
01_01166 "How's that?"  
01_01171 "Thanks, Russell."  
01_01172 "I know."  
01_01173 "Oh!"  
01_01174 "I did?"  
01_01176 "So, what's a Vortigaunt doing here?"  
01_01177 "Right, but I mean in general."  
01_01178 "Oh. I'm sorry to …"  
01_01180 "…Eli Vance…"  
01_01181 "The Combine have him, and I really do need to get moving."  
01_01182 "Look, I appreciate …"  
01_01183 "I can't stick around, I …"  
01_01184 "I'm sure it is, but …"  
01_01185 "Okay."  
01_01186 "I would help. I really would. But the Alyx Vance is honestly very busy saving her Dad."  
01_01187 "What?"  
01_01188 "Is? Or will be?"  
01_01190 "I'm sorry."  
01_01192 "I… haven't."  
01_01193 "Why?"  
01_01194 "Okay. Thanks. Are you done? Helping?"  
01_01195 "Uh… I'll eat it later. Thanks for the help."  
01_01197 "What'd you…?"  
01_01198 "Okay…"  
01_01199 "Thanks."  
01_01200 "Whoa whoa whoa whoa, waitwaitwait! I just… I just live here!"  
01_01201 "Hey! Wait wait no no no n …"  
01_01205 "Russell… what did you guys find back there?"  
01_01206 "The Citadel?"  
01_01207 "Russell? Just hang on, I'm almost there."  
01_05500 "Alright, it looks like the bridge is fully extended…"  
01_055003 "Okay, well, one of these has to bring in the vault for docking, right? Right?"  
01_055004 "Um. That's not it."  
01_055005 "Oooh, kay, definitely not."  
01_055006 "Maybe?!"  
01_055007 "That doesn't look good… Ugh!"  
01_05501 "Just need to GENTLY dock the vault TO the bridge."  
01_05502 "How hard can that be?"  
01_05508 "Keep what in?"  
01_11107 "Uh, sure. Yeah. I'll be there in a minute."  
01_11108 "Nope. It exploded. I'm fine, by the way."  
01_11110 "Russell. They've got Dad."  
01_11111 "Oh God…"  
01_11112 "Which is…?"  
01_11113 "Great. Let's hear it."  
01_11114 "Russell."  
01_11115 "Stop."  
01_11116 "And if he gets on that train… that's it, right?"  
01_11117 "I thought you said \"us.\""  
01_11119 "Okay."  
01_11121 ""Russells\"?"  
01_11122 "Got it."  
01_11126 "I'm already headed out on foot."  
01_11127 "Then I'm headed on foot."  
01_11131 "Thanks, Russell."  
01_11132 "Tell you what, Russell. If I die, I owe you a gun."  
01_11133 "I got a dead zombie here. I-I thought the Combine sealed up the QZ?"  
01_11134 "Probably not a one-off, then."  
01_11135 "Oof, they're gross."  
01_11140 "Hey, Russell. I just found a loose syringe of God knows what. Is this medicine?"  
01_11141 "I don't see one."  
01_11142 "I feel GREAT."  
01_11143 "I take it the Quarantine Zone is behind this hatch?"  
01_11144 "I'll look around for a control panel to open it up."  
01_11145 "I'm gonna head in. How far is Fairview Junction?"  
01_11146 "Have they started moving Dad yet?"  
01_11147 "Oh, that's great."  
01_11148 "Mm-hmm."  
01_11155 "So when did you start calling the gravity gloves the \"Russells\"?"  
01_11164 "How'd you meet my Dad, anyway? You guys worked together at Black Mesa, right?"  
01_11167 "Russell. Russell … I didn't eat it."  
01_11188 "Um, nope. Not once."  
01_11189 "You guys had all that? That's insane."  
01_11190 "Wow!"  
01_11191 "Yeah, you sure do."  
01_11194 "That is… Wow."  
01_11300 "Wait w-wait wait! Don't shoot!"  
01_11301 "DAD!"  
01_11305 "Whoa."  
01_11306 "Yeah, what happened?"  
01_11309 "Oof. I think that's the last of them."  
01_11310 "Got it!"  
01_11313 "Is it supposed to come off?!"  
01_11314 "W-w-what do I do…  What do I do now?!"  
01_11315 "I'm not panicking!"  
01_11322 "It won't stay!"  
01_11323 "Got it!"  
01_11325 "Holy crap!"  
01_11326 "Train train train train TRAIN!"  
01_11327 "I'm okay. Let's go find Dad."  
01_11336 "How do you know all of this?"  
01_11337 "Hey, how do I disconnect the cables?"  
01_11338 "Yep."  
01_11339 "I'm going to open it up and deactivate it."  
01_11340 "You're free now. It's okay, your friend sent me."  
01_11341 "What are they doing to you here?"  
01_11344 "We have to stop them from killing your friends."  
01_11345 "I can't get into the Vault if the substations are still online."  
01_11382 "Which means?"  
01_11400 "Gotta go."  
01_11401 "Let's talk later."  
01_11402 "Hold on, I gotta go."  
01_11403 "Russell, I gotta go."  
01_11404 "Later, gotta go."  
01_11405 "Hold on, I'm busy."  
01_11406 "Hold on, I got company."  
01_11407 "Crap, Combine."  
01_11408 "Russell!"  
01_11409 "It's good, Dad. Metro Cop movement is normal. Same for the Combine patrols. How's it going in the stockyard?"  
01_11413 "I see it!"  
01_11415 "Ahh!"  
01_11416 "What is that?"  
01_11417 "Oh boy."  
01_11418 "No shortcut?"  
01_11419 "Well… let's take the long way."  
01_11420 "Oh, man."  
01_11421 "Thanks. You know, for all your talk about what a \"lesser\" gun this is, this thing isn't half bad."  
01_11423 "Russell, are you seeing this?"  
01_11424 "It looks like it's just… cardboard."  
01_11425 "Yeah. Weird, though."  
01_11426 "I'm fine, Russell, what's up?"  
01_11427 "Russell? Russell! Crap."  
01_11428 "I … Look. Thank you for… everything. But I really have to go. And I'm sorry, but I really don't have time for riddles."  
01_11429 "Look, if I can, if I run across your friends, I will see what I can do."  
01_11434 "Yeah. IF."  
01_11435 "Wow. Russ."  
01_11447 "Well, you asked."  
01_11448 "Where… where are we?"  
01_11449 "What? Unless WHAT?"  
01_11456 "You know, Russell; Now that I'm walking into the Quarantine Zone… It just hit me. I don't know any thing about the Quarantine Zone."  
01_11457 "Alllright. Cool."  
01_11458 "You downloaded the entire Internet."  
01_11459 "Nice."  
01_11462 "NOW it's gonna get weird?"  
01_11465 "Okay, I'm bracing myself."  
01_11467 "I think… I think I killed all the aliens. I think they're all dead now."  
01_11468 "Now we just gotta get to the vault, get the weapon, kick the Combine off Earth … super easy … and they're … and there's sandwiches, there's gonna be sandwiches…"  
01_11469 "Good. I hope they're good."  
01_11474 "Okay, so: Right now, what it's like to live on Earth, on a scale of one to ten … I'd say we're at a two."  
01_11475 "What would you rate it BEFORE the Combine showed up?"  
01_11476 "Six? That's not great."  
01_11477 "Well, maybe we get the Combine off Earth and we could shoot for like an eight, you know?"  
01_11478 "So when we get the Combine off of earth, what are you going to do?"  
01_11479 "Oh, of course! You'll be sitting on a landmine!"  
01_11480 "So… this whole three year Russell plan… you think, uh… you think you'd have a job for me?"  
01_11481 "We could be partners."  
01_11482 "I don't know what any of that meant, but it sounds good, partner."  
01_11483 "Umm… uh, well, Dad and I would get a house and help rebuild, you know? And then I'd, you know probably start a secret lab."  
01_11484 "Well, yeah. So I'd start my lab and I wouldn't even need locks, or doors, or windows that close!"  
01_11485 "Ohhh. Pfft, right."  
01_11600 "Oh my God. Where's Dad?"  
01_11601 "Dad? DAD?"  
01_11602 "Dad!"  
01_11603 "I'm coming!"  
01_11605 "I'll be right there! One sec!"  
01_11607 "Okay. I'm going to reach out and pull you up. It's gonna be okay. You ready?"  
01_11608 "Give me your hand!"  
01_11609 "DAD!"  
01_11610 "\[Shocked Gasp\]"  
01_11611 "Thank you, oh my God, thank you! Dad, stay there! I'm gonna figure out how to get down to you!"  
01_11612 "A superweapon?"  
01_11613 "Then we've gotta steal it before they do!"  
01_11614 "So what's the plan?"  
01_11615 "Dad! Where's the vault?"  
01_11616 "I… yes. Look to the star. Got it. Dad?"  
01_11617 "Great! Thank you."  
01_11618 "I love you too!"  
01_11619 "Gotta go."  
01_12005 "Whoa!"  
01_12006 "AH!"  
01_12007 "HOLY!"  
01_12008 "GAH!"  
01_12009 "J-J-OH GOD"  
01_12011 "Alright, fair enough."  
01_12012 "Got it. Will it work on the Russells?"  
01_12020 "Ngh! It's on my face! On my face!"  
01_12021 "Oh my God, OH MY GOD… ON MY… OH GOD NO"  
01_12022 "Agh! Get off! Get off!"  
01_12023 "\[Straining, Gasping for Breath\]"  
01_12024 "I…m trying!"  
01_12028 "Yeah. It was."  
01_12040 "Any news on Dad?"  
01_12041 "Heard anything about Dad, Russell?"  
01_12042 "Damnit."  
01_12043 "How is that good news?"  
01_12044 "I'll take it."  
01_12045 "How do you know that?"  
01_12046 "Russell! I'm good! How's Dad?"  
01_12047 "I'm working on it."  
01_12048 "You're not gonna believe this, but I ran into a Vortigaunt."  
01_12049 "Hiding. I think he escaped from the Combine."  
01_12050 "You ever meet a Vortigaunt? He said crazy Vortigaunt stuff."  
01_12051 "Oh, that Vortigaunt I met? He did give me a headcrab to eat."  
01_12052 "The Combine off Earth. I want the Combine off Earth."  
01_12055 "I don't know. But we need to find Dad."  
01_12056 "You know … it got a bit messy back there, but we did get Dad back."  
01_12057 "What?"  
01_12058 "Holy crap. That's gotta be the Vault."  
01_12059 "So even if we MAKE it there, we still have to get UP to it."  
01_12060 "And break whatever's at the other end."  
01_12061 "Will I have to look out any windows to bring the Vault down?"  
01_12062 "Then I'm all for it."  
01_12066 ""Look to the Northern Star…\""  
01_12067 "No, no … the Vortigaunt said \"Look to the Northern Star\" to help his friends. Which sounds like Vortigaunt nonsense, but I guess it isn't."  
01_12068 "Like the power and security you'd need for a giant vault."  
01_12069 "And… there's the vault."  
01_12070 "I can't figure out how to get into this thing."  
01_12071 "Russell? You're breaking up again."  
01_12072 "I'll use a little bit of technology I like to call \"the stairs.\""  
01_12073 "Nevermind, I won't be using the stairs."  
01_12080 "Getting kinda crowded down here, Russ."  
01_12081 "Well, now I just want it more."  
01_12082 "I… I trust him."  
01_12083 "Russ. Trusting him is… our only plan here. He'll do this. We can do this."  
01_12084 "Well, it's huge so it shouldn't be hard to know which way I'm going."  
01_12085 "I don't understand what they're doing with it, here."  
01_12086 "If this weapon is so powerful, why keep it locked up in a dump like this?"  
01_12087 "Why not use it HERE?"  
01_12088 "Are you SEEING that?!"  
01_12089 "What is it?"  
01_12090 "Yes!"  
01_12091 "It better."  
01_12092 "Okay. So, what do you think?"  
01_12093 "Okay, I don't see a way into this building, so I'm going to look around."  
01_12094 "What is this place, anyway?"  
01_12095 "Is… vodka… good?"  
01_12096 "Russell doesn't like vodka, got it."  
01_12097 "But it's not good?"  
01_12098 "But…"  
01_12099 "Okay, that's all very confusing."  
01_12100 "There's definitely a bunch of old bottles in here. Does alcohol go bad?"  
01_12101 "Russell? You're breaking up."  
01_12102 "Well, oh well."  
01_12103 "Hey, Russ. Vortigaunts just took down another one."  
01_12104 "Russ! The Vorts are taking down another substation!"  
01_12105 "Russ? Ugh."  
01_12107 "More or less … you're breaking up."  
01_12108 "I made a friend named Jeff."  
01_12109 "Yeah, we're not really close."  
01_12110 "The Combine sealed up the exit in here. I'm getting it back open and getting outta here."  
01_12111 "I-I can't hear you. Russell!"  
01_12113 "Great. Also, little heads up, I think the tunnel is full of antlions, just in case I cut out permanently."  
01_12114 "Yeah, you know. Aliens with stabby legs."  
01_12115 "…No."  
01_12116 "No, that's not them. These ones are pretty dangerous."  
01_12117 "Yep. Off I go."  
01_12123 "WHAT?!"  
01_12124 "That's an antlion, Russell."  
01_12125 "Yes. So you DO know what antlions are."  
01_12126 "That's the last substation! He did it!"  
01_12128 "Guys. Can we figure this out later? That cable stirred up an antlion nest."  
01_12129 "I don't know. But something's keeping it up there. And we're running out of time to find it."  
01_12130 "Great! What is it, Dad?"  
01_12131 "Okay, got it."  
01_12132 "There's cables coming out of it. I think they connect to a power source. I'll get over there and disconnect them. Well. Shoot them."  
01_12134 "Right. What IS inside, anyway?"  
01_12135 "Oh man, Russ, don't jinx me."  
01_12136 "Oh crap. Moving. Moving."  
01_12137 "Textbook! Textbook jinxing, Russell!"  
01_12138 "Agh! Moving. Still moving."  
01_12139 "Gahhh!"  
01_12140 "Ahhh…"  
01_12143 "Russell! Big gun up ahead."  
01_12144 "Yeah, I just had it too."  
01_12145 "I just had it too. And it's a good one."  
01_12146 "I'm shooting it!"  
01_12147 "Russell, lemme shoot!"  
01_12149 "No. Probably not."  
01_12150 "Yeah."  
01_12151 "Everything'll be fine, Russ. Talk to you soon."  
01_12156 "Russell? I'm out."  
01_12157 "Hey, Russell? I, uh… I'm out again."  
01_12158 "Russell? I'm out. Again."  
01_12202 "Alyx! Alyx Vance!"  
01_12203 "Yep! I trapped Jeff in a trash compactor."  
01_12204 "And then I crushed him."  
01_12206 "Alyx! Alyx Vance!"  
01_12600 "Oh! Also … I spotted the Combine moving supplies into the Quarantine Zone. That place has been deserted for years."  
01_12604 "Ahh. Okay."  
01_12605 "Right."  
01_12606 "Russ, I promise, your gloves are safe with me."  
01_12607 "So is vodka any good?"  
01_12608 "Let me figure out how to get in, and then I'll find you some."  
01_12609 "There's no straight shot to the Vault. I'm gonna head inside and find a way around this barricade."  
01_12610 "There's no straight shot to the Vault. I'm gonna head inside and find a way out."  
01_12612 "Got it, thanks."  
01_12613 "\[Coughs\] Got it, thanks."  
01_12614 "Got it, thanks."  
01_12615 "Hooooly crap!"  
01_12616 "Have you heard any Combine chatter about Dad escaping?"  
01_12617 "On the plus side, that means Dad is still on his way back to you. We'd have heard if they'd recaptured Eli Vance."  
01_12618 "Getting to the Vault isn't going to get any easier."  
01_12646 "So… I AM eventually gonna run out of ammo."  
01_12650 "Ahh!"  
01_12651 "Ah!"  
01_12652 "Ahh!"  
01_12654 "Right. So… he's okay, right? He lives. My Dad lives."  
01_12656 "No! I-I-I just want to go home. Send me home!"  
01_12658 "Yep … they got the reactor, easy peasy."  
01_12660 "I'm headed back to the safehouse right now to meet Dad."  
01_12700 "Don't get greedy, guys. We're not made of time here."  
01_12702 "Sounds good. Where's the train I'm taking?"  
01_12703 "Yeah, we are."  
01_12704 "The brand name?"  
01_12706 "That's THE Vort!"  
01_12709 "Nah, I'm still looking."  
01_12710 "Here we go."  
01_12711 "Boom. Power back on."  
01_12712 "Now just have to get the elevator some juice."  
01_12713 "And up we…"  
01_12714 "Hmm."  
01_12715 "This place is overgrown. How dangerous do we think this stuff really is?			"  
01_12716 "I'm really starting to think I shouldn't be breathing this stuff."  
01_12717 "Kinda… slimy? A little tingly."  
01_12718 "Ow."  
01_12719 "Sharp."  
01_12720 "Like a six."  
01_12721 "A strong six."  
01_12722 "Yep. Of course."  
01_12723 "Uh oh, this guy's not wearing a shirt."  
01_12724 "Gotcha."  
01_12725 "Thannnk you."  
01_12726 "Oh, that's not good."  
01_12727 "There was like a… dog-looking… lightning thing."  
01_12728 "I killed it and it crapped out this thing?"  
01_12729 "Hey, Russell. This thing fell out of the dog."  
01_12730 "Ah crap, lightning dog."  
01_12731 "Oh my God, it went into a guy! Russell?"  
01_12732 "New development: It went into a dead guy."  
01_12733 "Yes. I had to shoot both of them, it was NUTS, Russell."  
01_12734 "Oh, it was."  
01_12735 "Uh oh."  
01_12736 "Yeah, oof. This one was… kinda rough."  
01_12737 "Yeah Russ, I'm good."  
01_12738 "I'm working on it."  
01_12739 "Found an elevator up."  
01_12746 "Alright, we're getting close to the substation here."  
01_12747 "I'll figure out how to shut it down."  
01_12748 "Alright … this should turn off that wall."  
01_12749 "Oh man."  
01_12750 "\[Gasps in Surprise\]"  
01_12751 "What do you think they're doing in here?"  
01_12754 "\[Grunts in Pain\]"  
01_12755 "\[Grunts in Pain\]"  
01_12756 "\[Grunts in Pain\]"

01_12763 "Ahh!"  
01_12764 "Ahh!"  
01_12765 "Unh!"  
01_12766 "I think you're right."  
01_12767 "It's too dark. I need a flashlight."  
01_12768 "I'll need a flashlight if I want to go in there."  
01_12769 "I'd never survive a jump from this height."  
01_12770 "Nope."  
01_12771 "I don't think so."  
01_12774 "Nope. That'll kill me."  
01_12779 "Ohh. Thank God."  
01_12780 "Ewww."  
01_13000 "Huh, I think I can reroute this with my multi-tool."  
01_13001 "It's a tool with multiple functions. So, you know … multi-tool."  
01_13002 "Who am I gonna sell it to?"  
01_13003 "Well, how about I call it the \"Alyx\"?"  
01_13004 "Yeah, the \"Alyx.\""  
01_13005 "Whoa! Here we go."  
01_13006 "Hey, Russ. Keep an eye out for Dad, okay?"  
01_13007 "Aaaand the power's out."  
01_13008 "Looks like we're taking the stairs."  
01_13009 "Aaaand the stairs are out."  
01_13010 "Ooo, breaker boxes."  
01_13012 "Let's go back to the elevator plan. I'm gonna get the power back on."  
01_13013 "Here we go … breaker boxes."  
01_13014 "Power's back on. Let's check the elevator."  
01_13015 "Argh! Rat's nest."  
01_13016 "Elevator's still not on yet."  
01_13017 "Y'know, this all looks good."  
01_13018 "Maybe we missed something out by the elevator."  
01_13019 "Looks like we're taking the ladder."  
01_13020 "THAT'S Jeff."  
01_13021 "THAT'S Jeff … keep your voice down!"  
01_13022 "He's an acquired taste."  
01_13023 "Ya know Russ, I'm sorry I didn't get you any vodka back there."  
01_13024 "You know, I hope you appreciate how much of a pain in the butt it is carrying this vodka around."  
01_13025 "Wait… Dad… What?!"  
01_13026 "Whoa, okay. So if it's not a weapon, are we still doing this?"  
01_13027 "True…"  
01_13028 "We've come this far, I say we keep going. And if you find out it's something we really shouldn't mess with, we'll call it off."  
01_13029 "So, head towards those beams, right?"  
01_13030 "Nothing, I'm on my way."  
01_13032 "Alright, here we go."  
01_13033 "Whoa, Russell, are you seeing this?"  
01_13035 "Alright, Russ. REALLY need you to talk again."  
01_13036 "Umm… before. What was life like before the Combine?"  
01_13037 "It's really dark… Russ?"  
01_13038 "Can you just… talk?"  
01_13039 "About anything, literally anything."  
01_13040 "Okay, that was my fault. I'll be more specific next time."  
01_13041 "There's somebody up there!"  
01_13042 "Whoa whoa! Shh!"  
01_13043 "Wait… SHH!"  
01_13044 "Shh! Sh-sh-shh Quiet!"  
01_13045 "Oh, wow. That's good, right?"  
01_13046 "Alright. So… let's go save Gordon Freeman."  
01_13047 "Oh. Incoming. Hey, gimme a second."  
01_13048 "Okay, so the plan is to get to that control room and get Gordon. You know, I'll be honest, people talk about him a lot, but I always just assumed he was dead."  
01_13049 "Hey, Dad. Are you there?"  
01_13050 "If Gordon survived Black Mesa… where's he been?"  
01_13051 "Once we get Gordon back, we can really get ambitious, don't you think, Russ? Maybe we could take down the Citadel."  
01_13052 "And this time he won't have to do it alone."  
01_13053 "Yeah, Dad."  
01_13054 "What's the security like inside?"  
01_13055 "I guess I'll have to improvise."  
01_13056 "There's the control room."  
01_13057 "Alright, here we go. Time to go rescue the savior of humanity."  
01_1305862 "Oh God."  
01_13059 "Damn it."  
01_13060 "Now what?"  
01_13061 "Oh! Terrific."  
01_13063 "Okay, okay, well, one of these has gotta extend the bridge… right?"  
01_13064 "Uhhh…"  
01_13065 "THIS one."  
01_13066 "I know, Russ, I can see it not moving."  
01_13067 "Oh God. Oh God… Oh GOD!"  
01_13068 "Ahhh!"  
01_13069 "Russ! Russell! Put Dad on!"  
01_13070 "Dad! We just took down a substation!"  
01_13071 "We will. You've still got that datapod, right?"  
01_13072 "For sure. You go ahead, I'll be fine, Dad … I promise."  
01_13073 "Holy crap, they must've been terrified of this thing."  
01_13086 "Nope. Still looking."  
01_13087 "Russel… the Combine use these. Are they safe for people?"  
01_13088 "Are you sure?"  
01_13089 "Ow! Ow-ow-ow. \[Sucking in Air\]"  
01_13090 "Ahhhhh. Hey…"  
01_13091 "Hey… you were right. These are great."  
01_13092 "Ahhh. Ooh."  
01_13093 "Ahhh. Nice."  
01_13094 "See it!"  
01_13096 "Thanks. Thanks Russell."  
01_13097 "Yeah… When you guys were off stealing the reactor, I saw the Combine moving supplies in here. So, I guess they're interested in this place again."  
01_13098 "What IS that?"  
01_13099 "It looks like pictures of Vortigaunts…"  
01_13100 "Somebody spent a lot of time on this."  
01_13101 "Whoa! More floating cardboard."  
01_13102 "That's weird."  
01_13103 "Just stay there! I'm gonna figure out how to get over to you!"  
01_13104 "Ooo, grenades."  
01_13105 "Ugh. Total waste of a grenade."  
01_13106 "Agreed."  
01_13108 "Heads up, zombie."  
01_13109 "Look out."  
01_13111 "Missed!"  
01_13112 "Dammit!"  
01_13113 "Ugh!"  
01_13114 "Yes!"  
01_13115 "Whoa!"

01_13124 "…I hate you, Jeff…"  
01_13125 "\[Laughing in Relief\] We did it, Russ."  
01_13130 "Got it."  
01_13131 "Whoa! Yeah, okay. I'm going up."  
01_13132 "Dad? Dad?"  
01_13133 "Gordon… Freeman?"  
01_13135 "So… who are you?"  
01_13140 "Phew. Okay."  
01_13141 "Okay."  
01_13142 "Oof…"

01_13203 "Open the damn window!"  
01_13500 "Thanks Russ."  
01_13900 "You know, I hope you appreciate how much of a pain in the butt it is carrying this crate of vodka around."  
01_13901 "Oh, I…m taking one of these for myself."  
01_20000 "\[Grunts in Pain\]"  
01_20001 "Thank you!"  
01_20003 "\[Coughing\] …what… is…?"

01_20100 "I'm on it."  
01_20101 "I can see that, Russell."  
01_20102 "Yep, doing great, no worries no worries no worries…"  
01_20104 "I saw a lever outside!"  
01_20105 "It switches the tracks!"  
01_20106 "…to a wall."  
01_20108 "I don't know!"  
01_20109 "There's gotta be another way to stop this train…"  
01_20111 "You sure you can do that?"  
01_20112 "Nice."

01_20127 "I'll be ready."  
01_20129 "Yes, WHEN."  
01_20135 "Oh, Dad said he stole some files about this weapon."  
01_20136 "You're my guy?…"  
01_20137 "Oh."  
01_20138 "But not data encryption."

01_20150 "Wait, what the…"  
01_20151 "I heard him."  
01_20152 "I hope whoever is in there is worth it."  
01_20164 "Maybe we'd have lasted eight."  
01_20166 "I'm on my way."  
01_20169 "Phew, thanks."  
01_20170 "Oh. Yeah, definitely. You're gonna want to put that in Year Two."  
01_20173 "Yeah, what is it, Dad?"  
01_20174 "…What do you mean?"

01_20280 "Yeuch."  
01_20281 "You see that? Russell? Russell!"  
01_50600 "Russ, come on. At this point it's kind of \"our\" gun."  
01_50601 "You know, Russ … technically? I don't think there's a whole lot of your gun left anymore."  
01_50602 "Well, Russ, it's official. There is NOTHING left of your gun in this gun. This is just… this is MY gun."  
01_50700 "Oh! That zombie has a shotgun!"  
01_50701 "Whoa!"  
01_50702 "Yeah. Let's get this shotgun and get out of here."  
01_50703 "Got it!"

01_60033 "Aah!"  
01_70000 "Just looking, Russ."  
01_70002 "I think… it's some kind of lock."  
01_70003 "I think we just got locked in here."  
01_70004 "Got it. Thanks."  
01_70005 "Oh boy…"  
01_70006 "Health station!"  
01_70007 "Ahh. Here, look. It needs power."  
01_70008 "Huh."  
01_70009 "Russell? How do you know all this."  
01_70010 "Whew, it is DARK."  
01_70011 "Nope. I'm good, I'm good."  
01_70012 "Oh, thank God."

01_70017 "Well… That worked."  
01_70018 "Okay."

01_70024 "Got it."  
01_70025 "Ah. There it is."  
01_70026 "Ah ha."  
01_70027 "I see 'em."  
01_70028 "Russ, you're not even here!"  
01_70029 "There it is, Russ!"  
01_70030 "The tunnel out of here?"  
01_70031 "Russ? Do you think a headcrab could turn a gorilla into a zombie?"  
01_70032 "On it."  
01_70035 "\[Sniffs\] Ugh. This stuff reeks."  
01_70036 "Like a rotting animal mixed with… ammonia."  
01_70043 "What if it GIVES me cancer?"  
01_70044 "Russ, I'm gonna do less touching."  
01_70060 "Russell! These guys have automatic weapons!"  
01_70061 "These guys have automatic weapons."  
01_70063 "I'll keep my fingers crossed on the, uh… option one. Just gonna roll with the genes I'm currently working with."  
01_70064 "That's a lot of words while a lot of bullets are flying at me, Russ!"  
01_70099 "Oh my god, Russ. This ID card has a picture of a skeleton on it."  
01_70500 "Combine!"  
01_70501 "Russ, these guys have automatic weapons."  
01_70503 "I'm… I'm good, Russ. I'm just going to roll with these genes that I've got."  
01_70504 "The more I touch this stuff, the more I think it's probably toxic."  
01_70505 "There it is. That elevator will take me up to the substation."  
01_70506 "Not to be a worrier, but shouldn't Dad be back by now?"  
01_70507 "Yeah. So I should be worried."  
01_70508 "How are you sure?"  
01_70509 "Nice."  
01_70510 "I know. You would've loved that."  
01_70511 "The substation is on the floor above me."  
01_70512 "Alright, there's the substation, I'll get up to the next floor and we'll shut it down."  
01_70605 "Nnngh!"

01_70898 "Are they … you know, sucking his brain out?"  
01_70899 "Well, either way, let's not find out. I'll get there before it happens."

01_70901 "Yeah."  
01_70902 "No way."  
01_70903 "Well, when I get him out, let's give him a gun."  
01_70904 "Russ!"  
01_70905 "How's Dad doing? Does he seem okay?"  
01_70906 "Good. Well, thanks."  
01_70907 "Yeah, you know he was missing a leg before."  
01_70908 "Thanks, Russ."  
01_70909 "Hey … Any news on the datapod?"  
01_70910 "Great."

## Eli

02_01103 "Alyx! How's it looking up there?"  
02_01104 "\[Laughs\] One Combine mini-reactor from a shipment of 4000. They're never gonna miss it. Here, see for yourself."  
02_01105 "Hmm. That IS odd. Well, we'll look into it when we get back."  
02_01106 "Meet back at the safehouse, baby. We'll be there soon. What is it, Russell?"  
02_01107 "\[Groaning in Pain\]"  
02_01110 "\[Groaning\]"  
02_01114 "Russell? Where is he? Is he alright?"  
02_01118 "We don't have time. It's a weapon, Alyx! It's what they're hiding in here. It-It's what we found out about and that's why they grabbed us."  
02_01119 "They got it in a vault… a tower, with security all around it."  
02_01120 "There's a substation nearby."  
02_01130 "See? I'll be fine. Now get moving."  
02_01132 "Alyx, whatever this weapon is, you need to either steal it or destroy it."  
02_01136 "\[Chuckling\] I love you, baby."  
02_01216 "I love you, baby!"  
02_01223 "What is it, Russell?"  
02_01300 "We didn't steal anything!"  
02_01301 "No one! I didn't see anyone!"  
02_01350 "Agh! "  
02_01500 "Baby!  "  
02_01502 "I'm over here, honey! I need help, hurry!"  
02_01503 "Baby! Over here!"  
02_01504 "Help me up… help me up…"  
02_01506 "Hurry, baby! Hurry! I'm losing my grip."  
02_01507 "\[Groaning in Pain\]"  
02_01508 "Ungh!"  
02_01509 "Almost… Almost… Gah!"  
02_01510 "No! Alyx, listen! The thing Russell and I found is some sort of… some sort of superweapon!"  
02_01511 "It's something big. They've got it here in the QZ in some kind of vault. But they're about to move it. Where, I don't know, but it's going to be soon."  
02_01512 "Yes! And look, look… I managed to pocket this Combine datapod. If I can decrypt it, we can figure out how to use their weapon against them."  
02_01513 "You head to the Vault. I'll take this thing back to Russell's and get to work."  
02_01514 "It's right in the middle of the QZ, and it's big. Get above ground and see what you can find."  
02_01515 "Go!"  
02_01517 "Yeah… I'm good."  
02_01600 "Gordon! Gordon! Wake up, Gordon!"  
02_01601 "She's gone, Gordon. She's GONE."  
02_01602 "Son of a bitch and his \"unforeseen consequences\"! I knew it. When I get my hands on him, I'm gonna… I'm gonna KILL him. I've got to figure this out. Right now…"  
02_01603 "\[Exhaling Deeply\]"  
02_01604 "Come on, Gordon."  
02_01605 "We've got work to do."  
02_01606 "I don't know, but …"  
02_01607 "You keep heading for the Vault. I'll poke around the datapod. See if I can figure something out."  
02_01608 "Alyx! I found something!"  
02_01609 "There's a Gravity Field Generator directly under the Vault. That's GOT to be what's keeping it up."  
02_01610 "Russell, stop her!"  
02_01611 "Alyx! Don't go in the V … \[Signal Cuts Out\]"  
02_01614 "Right there. That's the Gravity Field Generator."  
02_01615 "Russell! Goddamn, it's good to see you!"  
02_01616 "Alyx! Baby!"  
02_01619 "There it goes…"  
02_01621 "I'm working on it. Alyx, find a way in there. Go!"  
02_01702 "\[Groaning in Pain\]"  
02_01704 "Stay safe, baby. I love you."  
02_02000 "Prison…"  
02_02001 "It's not a vault. It's a prison. They didn't build it to keep us OUT. They're trying to keep something IN."  
02_02002 "The way I see it, whatever's in there doesn't like the Combine very much. So we've got THAT in common."  
02_02003 "So… Are we still doing this?"  
02_02004 "That's my girl. I'll let you know what I find out."  
02_02005 "Tell Alyx there's no way that backup is stable. She can shut it down."  
02_02006 "Goddamn it, Russ, they've got Gordon Freeman."  
02_02007 "This is very, VERY good."  
02_02008 "Damn right. We're gonna get Gordon Freeman back."  
02_02009 "Yeah, what's up, Alyx?"  
02_02010 "I don't know. But I bet it's a hell of a story."  
02_02011 "Alyx… You there?"  
02_02012 "It looks like you WILL be able to get into the Vault from up there. There's a terminal that extends a bridge to the entrance."  
02_02013 "I've got it all laid out in front of me and I'll tell you… There IS security, but I've never seen anything like it. It doesn't make any sense."  
02_02014 "Eh, don't worry, honey. I'll figure it out."  
02_02015 "You know, honey, you haven't been doing too bad yourself."  
02_02016 "Earth could've used you in the Seven Hour War."  
02_02017 "Alyx? Alyx! Alyx, are you okay?"  
02_02018 "I don't know. I'm not sure if this datapod even knows. But they got something trapped in there."  
02_02019 "I do. Russ, this thing's biocoded. I'm gonna need the TLI."  
02_02020 "Okay, great. You good, honey?"  
02_02021 "Keep that promise. I'll get to work on the datapod."  
02_02022 "I've got something."  
02_02023 "I don't know what the weapon is yet. But I DO know how they got it."  
02_02024 "It doesn't look like they actually built the weapon. It's like they… I don't know, discovered something. Or maybe they uncovered it."  
02_02025 "If I'm reading this right, they tracked it to an old apartment building in the QZ. But instead of going in to get it, they grabbed the whole building and built a vault around it."  
02_02026 "I'm trying to figure out whether WE oughta be."  
02_02030 "You can thank that Vortigaunt. He got me back here in one piece."  
02_02040 "Thank you… Thank you… Oh God…"  
02_03000 "\[Gasping for Breath\]"  
02_03001 "What is it, Russell?"  
02_03002 "Russell, let her think!"  
02_03004 "Good. Because when they move this thing, that weapon's gone. We need to get it tonight."  

## Russell

05_00003 "What… is…?"  
05_00004 "It looks like … "  
05_00005 "Put on the headset!"

05_00007 "Alyx! Put … Alyx! P-Put on the headset!"  
05_00008 "Alyx! If you're still alive, put on the headset."  
05_00009 "I can see you in there! There's no reason you shouldn't be putting on the headset! Alyx!"  
05_00010 "It's not a trick! It's Russell, alright? Your dad's friend from work! The Resistance!"  
05_00011 "It's not a trick, Alyx!"  
05_00012 "Alyx! You there? You-You've got to get moving."  
05_00013 "I know! I caused it! So technically not an accident. You've got to get moving."  
05_00014 "You've got to get moving!"  
05_00015 "Get moving, Alyx."  
05_00016 "Alyx, you need to get out of here. Now."  
05_00017 "He's fine. Follow the drone."  
05_00019 "Yeah. Well, no. To be honest, he's in huge trouble."  
05_00020 "They've still got him. He was in a separate transport."  
05_00021 "Well, yes. I had no way of knowing who was in which van. So… Yes. The result was that I saved YOU."  
05_00022 "Criminal holding. And then, when they realize he's Eli Vance… to Nova Prospekt."  
05_00023 "But I'm already working on a plan to get him back."  
05_00024 "You're close to my lab. Keep following the drone! We'll figure out what to do."  
05_00027 "Alyx, everything cut out for a second! I lost the headset video feed. Can you see my drone? Is it okay?"  
05_00031 "Alyx, great. Okay, let's … wait. My drone's okay, right?"  
05_00036 "Now. Pretty soon they're gonna realize that your dad is not gonna talk. And when THAT happens, he's off to have his brain sucked out."  
05_00037 "Potentially. Maybe not, though. I mean, he could … they could just drill into his … "  
05_00038 "Oh, yep. Still your dad. Right. Well, what they WILL do is take him by train from HERE… "  
05_00039 "Not necessarily. Grab something that represents us."  
05_00040 "Anything'll do."  
05_00041 "Yeah, just grab anything."  
05_00042 "I'll tell you what, I'll do it."  
05_00043 "Okay, that's you."  
05_00044 "Well, ONE of us … me … will have to stay here for this plan to work."  
05_00045 "Just outside there's a second train that also leads out of City 17, through the Quarantine Zone."  
05_00046 "Both trains intersect here, at Fairview Junction. You take your train, get there before his train, and hack into the controls. That'll let me take over the system."  
05_00047 "Train comes to a halt. You deal with the Combine situation. And we get your dad back."  
05_00048 "Out the back, through the yard. It's decommissioned, but I think I can hack into its controls."  
05_00049 "Oh. And get yourself a pair of \"Russells\" on your way out."  
05_00050 "The gloves, Alyx. You know, the gravity gloves. I have a few sets through there. You can calibrate them out by the shed."  
05_00051 "We can do this, Alyx. You got that, didn't you? That I said we could do it? 'Cause we're gonna do it."  
05_00052 "I'm with you every step of the way."  
05_00053 "Alright, you know how this goes. There should be a bunch of junk down there. Aim at something with your hand open."  
05_00054 "Just point your hand at something."  
05_00055 "These gloves aren't going to calibrate by themselves. But I suppose they probably should. That's one thing I haven't… fixed on them."  
05_00056 "Now close your hand and flick it towards you."  
05_00057 "Just a little flick of the wrist."  
05_00058 "Are you flicking? I can't tell if you're flicking."  
05_00059 "Close and flick. "  
05_00060 "Okay, the reference sensor is way out of alignment."  
05_00061 "Try again. Pick a target, aim at it, hand open."  
05_00062 "Hmm."  
05_00063 "Try again."  
05_00064 "One more time."  
05_00065 "Pick a target, aim at it, hand open."  
05_00066 "Excellent! Now make a fist."  
05_00067 "Alright, make a fist."  
05_00068 "Registered. Now flick your wrist to bring it in."  
05_00069 "Almost done. Do it again, only this time catch it."  
05_00070 "Flick it again and try to catch it."  
05_00071 "Perfect. We're done. Ooh! Oh, wait! I-I almost forgot."  
05_00072 "Alyx! Up here!"  
05_00073 "You're gonna need a gun!"  
05_00074 "It's unloaded now!"  
05_00076 "Pick up the gun, Alyx!"  
05_00077 "I doubt you'll need to use it much. There shouldn't be more than a few Combine transporting Eli."  
05_00082 "And good luck, Alyx. Goodbye."  
05_00084 "Obviously, just to let you know, I am still here, though."  
05_00085 "That's the train, Alyx. See if you can hack the door open. I've almost got the train online here."  
05_00086 "Is there any way to hack the train door?"  
05_00087 "See if you can get the door open."  
05_00088 "Alright! Here we go. Next stop: Fairview Junction."  
05_00091 "Good. I'll see if I can get you in some other way. "  
05_00092 "Ahh… Would you look at that. Resin."  
05_00099 "Well, you know… in case it doesn't make it back."  
05_00101 "Ah, this one must've squirted out. I heard they've had trouble with barnacle spores outside the containment area. But not about fellas like this."  
05_00102 "I'd doubt it."  
05_00103 "Careful of that barnacle, Alyx."  
05_00107 "Does it have a skull and crossbones on it?"  
05_00108 "Probably medicine, then."  
05_00109 "Alyx! Did you just inject yourself with something you found on the ground? "  
05_00110 "Yeah, yeah, that's where they keep it."  
05_00111 "That's the control panel. They've probably scrambled the circuit. But considering no one would be dumb enough to open the hatch, it shouldn't be too hard to put back."  
05_00112 "You'll go through the old subway tunnels on your way to the train yard."  
05_00113 "I don't think so. Which could be good news, because we've still got time."  
05_00114 "Or bad news, because they've already killed him. And you don't need to move a corpse. You just bury it. Or burn it. You still there, Alyx?"  
05_00121 "Ahh, right. The \"Alyx.\""  
05_00123 "Ahh, right. So it can hack everything. If you give it enough time. Probably takes a while, though, right?"  
05_00124 "Can it manipulate gravity at a distance?"  
05_00125 "Right. Didn't think so. Not in glove form either, I noticed."  
05_00126 "Alright, 'nuff chit-chat, we've gotta go and save your dad. Come on."  
05_00127 "Yeah. Well, no. Tricky place to get a job at. I interviewed at Black Mesa. They said try again in a year. I don't need to tell you what happened after that. Lucky break for me, really. Not a lot of survivors. Honestly, it's a miracle you and your dad got out of there."  
05_00128 "Alyx? You cut out for a while. What happened?"  
05_00129 "A Vortigaunt? What was he doing down there?"  
05_00130 "Oh! Great! What did it taste like? Tell me how you f … "  
05_00131 "Right. Of course you didn't. No, that's… that's the right decision."  
05_00157 "Yes, Alyx?"  
05_00158 "Ah! Excellent. Alyx, have you ever heard of a club sandwich?"  
05_00159 "Right. To make a club sandwich, you need to start with bread. Not from a bread line. From a bakery across the street, baked that day, okay? You add tomatoes, lettuce … not vegetable paste … fresh. Then you add bacon … that's from an animal we used to call the \"pig.\" You toast the bread, and you put all that inside it."  
05_00160 "It is! And I'm not done. Then you add a second sandwich on top of the first one. You put ham in it … also from a pig … and turkey, from an animal we used to call the \"turkey,\" and more tomato, more lettuce, and a bunch of other things I'm forgetting. It was six inches tall and weighed a pound and had a dozen ingredients from five different continents. It was the most impossible food item you could imagine in any age before ours. "  
05_00162 "…This is Eli…"  
05_00165 "Close…"  
05_00166 "…and flick."  
05_00167 "Don't worry, it's unloaded!"  
05_00168 "You do? Okay. Good. Well… Successful experiment. Keep an eye out for more."  
05_00169 "I know, right?"  
05_00200 "Well, that's the crazy thing, I don't know! Just… blurry pictures of a… building."  
05_00201 "Nah, something else. And whatever it is, they're gonna kill anybody who saw it, and anybody who knows anybody who saw it. Which means us… and your dad."  
05_00202 "I know. This… this is bad. They're gonna find out what he knows, and then… Yeah, they're gonna kill him."  
05_00203 "But! The good news is, we've got something they don't."  
05_00204 "My plan to get him back!"  
05_00205 "Right. Good, well that's the… that's the main…"  
05_00300 "That's it."  
05_00301 "Boom, yep."  
05_00302 "You're on it."  
05_00303 "Targeted."  
05_00304 "You're attached."  
05_00305 "Yep, you're tethered."  
05_00306 "Close your hand."  
05_00307 "Now close it."  
05_00308 "Make a grip."  
05_00309 "Now close your hand."  
05_00310 "Great."  
05_00311 "Yep."  
05_00312 "That's it."  
05_00313 "Just like that."  
05_00314 "Perfect."  
05_00315 "Again, but catch it."  
05_00316 "But catch it."  
05_00318 "Now catch it."  
05_00319 "Try catching it."  
05_00320 "Catch it."  
05_00321 "Alyx, imagine there's a, like a, trigger on, ah… on the \"Russells.\""  
05_00322 "Now aim your hand…"  
05_00323 "Pull the trigger…"  
05_00324 "And there you go."  
05_00325 "Alyx, there should be a small trigger near the index finger on each of your Russells."  
05_00327 "Oh. Almost forgot, guns need ammo."  
05_00328 "Here you go!"  
05_00329 "Alyx, up here! Heads up, throwing down some ammo."  
05_00330 "Here you go."  
05_00333 "Oh, you uh, took care of that lock, then. Good. Great. Did have the key for it. But should've given you that, that's… that's on me."  
05_00334 "Hello, Alyx? We MIGHT have a problem. Probably nothing to worry about, but … "  
05_00335 "Did the train stop? It stopped, didn't it."  
05_00336 "Ugh, it's jammed. When the Combine shut down the Quarantine Zone, they must have tightened security. "  
05_00337 "Yeah, you're nowhere near Fairview Junction. You're just outside the QZ. "  
05_00338 "And THIS… is as far as we get by train."  
05_00342 "Good, because we don't have much time."  
05_00343 "There's a control station override nearby."  
05_00344 "Alyx, that's the control panel right there."  
05_00345 "If you can bring the system back to life I should be able to stop Eli's train."  
05_00346 "Alyx, that's the control panel!"  
05_00350 "That's the opposite of what it's supposed to do, Alyx!"  
05_00352 "Uh… well… don't panic! Or stop panicking! If-If you are."  
05_00362 "Okay, just throw the switch, there."  
05_00363 "You've got to hold it down!"  
05_00364 "Quickly, Alyx!"  
05_00365 "Good! Now keep the lever held down otherwise the track will switch back."  
05_00366 "Hold it down, Alyx!"  
05_00367 "Good God!"  
05_00368 "Yeah. Wow. You okay?"  
05_00378 "Just shoot them, Alyx!"  
05_00379 "Great, now go inside and deactivate the power source."  
05_00380 "Good grief, it's a Vortigaunt…"  
05_00388 "Watch it, Alyx!"  
05_00389 "Alyx, look out!"  
05_00390 "Dead ahead!"  
05_00391 "Incoming!"  
05_00393 "Combine!"  
05_00394 "You've got company."  
05_00395 "You've got it."  
05_00396 "to… Nova Prospekt."  
05_00398 "What IS this?"  
05_00400 "We'll talk later."  
05_00403 "Let's talk later."  
05_00404 "Go get 'em!"  
05_00405 "Yeah yeah, go."  
05_00411 "And if there's resin around here, there should be a Combine fabricator. Keep an eye out, we might be able to upgrade your firepower a bit."  
05_00412 "Alyx! I think that's a Combine fabricator. Put something in it, I want to see how this thing works."  
05_00414 "Headcrab!"  
05_00415 "Wait … where'd it go?"  
05_00416 "Aah!"  
05_00417 "Yep. There it is. Found it."  
05_00418 "Do you hear that?"  
05_00419 "Yeah. That's… that's the way we gotta go."  
05_00420 "Yeah, that IS the shortcut."  
05_00421 "Yeah, that's also the long way."  
05_00422 "Alright, that seemed to work. Let's keep doing that."  
05_00423 "\[Laughs\]"  
05_00424 "Ha ha! That barnacle's on our side. It's not though, obviously, so don't walk under them."  
05_00426 "Nice shooting, Alyx."  
05_00429 "Ah, possibly. Are you seeing floating garbage?"  
05_00430 "Right. Well, seems harmless."  
05_00431 "Alyx! You alright? What's wrong?"  
05_00432 "I'm losing your signal! Alyx? Alyx? If you can still hear me, keep heading in the same direction, and-and try to get above ground!"  
05_00433 "Alyx! Alyx! The signal's back! Can you hear me? Are you okay?"  
05_00434 "Ten seconds, Alyx!"  
05_00435 "Train's here in ten seconds, Alyx!"  
05_00436 "Five seconds!"  
05_00437 "Four!"  
05_00438 "Three!"  
05_00439 "Two!"  
05_00440 "One!"  
05_00453 "Well actually, the word quarantine comes from the Italian, \"quaranta giorni,\" uh, which means forty days … the period that all ships were required to be isolated before crew could go ashore during the Black Death."  
05_00456 "Yeah, yeah it is."  
05_00459 "Alyx. I'm seeing a high concentration of anti-particles radiating off that thing. Just warning you. Quantum-wise, it might get weird in there."  
05_00460 "Yeah."  
05_00461 "Yes."  
05_00462 "That's good. Good. That's great."  
05_00463 "Yes. Absolutely."  
05_00464 "Yep! Crystal clear!"  
05_00465 "You're extremely good at killing aliens!"  
05_00466 "It's alarming, actually!"  
05_00467 "Yep, could always get worse."  
05_00468 "Ooh, that's a toughie. I don't know, uh, good day? I'd say six. Yeah, strong six."  
05_00469 "Well, that's life, Alyx. You know, it's not always great."  
05_00470 "Ooh, an eight. Yeah, that'd really would be nice. Really nice."  
05_00471 "I'm going full production mode on the \"Russells,\" of course."  
05_00472 "Goldmine, yep. So here's the plan, conservative estimate, I figure one year to get the world unconquered by the Combine, get them off the planet. So that's year one."  
05_00473 "Then another year to mass produce the \"Russells.\" Although, just quietly, we WILL need to rebuild society first, you know, to get some basic infrastructure, jobs, money, that sort of thing. Otherwise people won't be able to buy them. You know."  
05_00474 "So uh, yeah… THREE year plan. Let's slot the infrastructure thing in for year two."  
05_00476 "Ooh, well, uh… Hmm. Well, there would be stock options. Five to ten year vesting period, obviously. Could be very lucrative for you, Alyx. In the long term."  
05_00477 "Yep. Sounds good… Alyx."  
05_00478 "So once we get the combine off the Earth, what are you gonna do with yourself, Alyx?"  
05_00479 "Well, it wouldn't actually have to be secret. You could just live your life out in the open."  
05_00480 "Well… no, there'll still be criminals. Just no aliens."  
05_00481 "So I'd say a yes on the doors and locks just uh… yeah. Just for caution. And keep the gun."  
05_00482 "Job? Alyx, you invented the \"Alyx\"! Of course you can have a job!"  
05_00600 "That's your dad's prisoner pod."  
05_00602 "Oh God."  
05_00603 "Alyx, hurry!"  
05_00605 "Oh jeez, oh jeez."  
05_00606 "Agh!"  
05_00607 "Wait a … hm. Where IS the Vault?"  
05_00608 "I'm with you every step of the way."  
05_00700 "Agh!"  
05_00701 "Oof!"  
05_00702 "Whoa!"  
05_00703 "Aah!"  
05_00705 "No, but it should fix up that pistol nicely. Good thing too, I gave you one of my lesser guns."  
05_00706 "You owe me a gun anyway! That wasn't a gift. That's MY gun."  
05_00707 "Wait, is that a dead Combine soldier?"  
05_00709 "Oh, keep an eye out. Something's definitely up."  
05_00712 "Agh! Oh God!"  
05_00713 "Get it off!"  
05_00714 "It's disgusting!"  
05_00715 "Ugh, it's horrific!"  
05_00717 "Oh, thank God."  
05_00718 "Ugh, Alyx, that was vile…"  
05_00728 "Yeah, they're putting him on the train now. Which is good. Because it means he's still alive."  
05_00729 "No. Radio silence since he got on the train."  
05_00730 "Well, the good news is, they're going to torture him when they get to Nova Prospekt."  
05_00731 "Because logically speaking, they have no reason to do it on the train ride there."  
05_00732 "Well, the good news is he's probably fine."  
05_00733 "Because they're taking him to Nova Prospekt to torture him. That's the torture place. So they're hardly gonna torture him before they GET there. So he's fine. Logically speaking."  
05_00734 "They've got him on the train. He's on the move. You gotta find Fairview Junction before they get there."  
05_00735 "So anything happen when you cut out?"  
05_00736 "A Vortigaunt? What was he doing down there?"  
05_00737 "W-what did he say?"  
05_00738 "What the hell are those?"  
05_00739 "Yeaahhh…"  
05_00740 "Uh, that's probably gonna draw some attention. Not probably, actually. It's definitely drawing attention. Look, they're looking for you now. Okay? So just be careful."  
05_00741 "Alyx! Look out the window!"  
05_00742 "I'm serious, Alyx. Look out the window. Is that what I think it is?"  
05_00743 "Okay, good. You found it. Now go look out the window. Come on. I can't look at it unless you do."  
05_00744 "Yeah. Your dad didn't mention it was floating."  
05_00745 "The cables! Look at all the cables attached to it."  
05_00746 "All we have to do is follow them…"  
05_00747 "And down comes the Vault. Simple. Easy to follow. Yeah, I like this plan."  
05_00748 "Alright, you … for a good reason, I'm sure … refused to look out the window."  
05_00749 "So forget the window. On the other side of it was the VAULT your dad wanted us to look for. It's floating in the air, which makes it tricky for us to get to."  
05_00750 "But! It's covered in cables. I reckon if we follow the cables and destroy whatever they're connected to we should be able to bring the Vault down."  
05_00751 "No, I don't think so."  
05_00753 "I am. Why are you saying it like that?"  
05_00754 "Ohhh. Yeah, that does make more sense."  
05_00755 "Hmm. That's some sort of Combine substation. They usually generate power and host security protocols."  
05_00756 "Yeah, that substation must be what's keeping it in the air. We need to get up there."  
05_00757 "There's no way they'd leave an unsecured entrance on the street."  
05_00758 "Find a way into the hotel and make your way to the roof."  
05_00759 "Alyx, I think you should find your way into that hotel and get up to the substation."  
05_00760 "Ooh! Elevator. That's our way up."  
05_00761 "Ah. Get to the roof. Find the substation."  
05_00762 "Okay, now just make your  to the roof and get access to that station."  
05_00763 "There's a lift, there, but it's going to be a pain to restore the power."  
05_00764 "Yeah, I-I-I get it."  
05_00765 "Ohhh."  
05_00766 "Comm channel's gone crazy since we took out that substation. They know we're after the Vault now. Whatever's in there, they really REALLY don't want us to have it."  
05_00767 "Now that's the spirit."  
05_00768 "We're putting a lot of trust in that Vortigaunt to shut down all the substations."  
05_00769 "Yes. Me too. Uh… because if he doesn't, that Vault isn't going anywhere. And we'll be standing there, with no Vault to break into, surrounded by Combine, and … "  
05_00770 "Yes. You're right. He'll be fine. We're all going to be fine."  
05_00771 "Okay, there's no direct path from where you are to the Vault. So you're going to have to snake your way there."  
05_00772 "My guess is they're trying to find a way to ship it off Earth. Back to their home or some other planet."  
05_00773 "…They already won this war, Alyx."  
05_00774 "Whoa, Alyx!"  
05_00775 "The Vortigaunts are taking down the substation!"  
05_00776 "This might work."  
05_00777 "Alyx! Drone's back in action! From up here it looks like there's Combine barricades up ahead that are stopping anyone from getting any closer to the Vault."  
05_00778 "Make your way into the distillery and see where it takes you. With my drone back online we've finally got the upper … oh no, you're kidding me!"  
05_00779 "Oh, you're kidding me!"  
05_00781 "It's a distillery. They made vodka and things like that."  
05_00782 "Oh God, no."  
05_00783 "Well, I … I never said that!"  
05_00784 "It's poison…"  
05_00785 "…but I love it. Everyone… everyone loves it."  
05_00786 "Wonderful if you… if you could, actually, yes. "  
05_00787 "It only improves! It's all good, Alyx!"  
05_00788 "The vodka's good, Alyx! The vodka is good!"  
05_00789 "Alyx! Come in, Alyx! Alyx? Ah, there you are. There you are."  
05_00790 "Oh good! That's great news!"  
05_00791 "Okay, uh, well if I cut out again, remember: Vodka doesn't go off, okay? Lasts forever."  
05_00792 "Alyx, you're never going to believe…"  
05_00793 "Alyx, come in. Hey Alyx! Oh, there you are. Can you hear me?"  
05_00794 "I think you're still in the distillery."  
05_00795 "Well, that's great. We can take all the help we can get."  
05_00796 "Good! Uh, I'll try and figure out where it leads."  
05_00797 "I found a bunch of subterranean map data for your area of the city!"  
05_00798 "Subterranean. It means underground. You know, underneath. Alyx? Alyx?"  
05_00800 "Good news: that tunnel heads to the Vault."  
05_00801 "Antlions, antlions, antlions…"  
05_00802 "Oh! Yes! And very small, like ants!"  
05_00803 "Uh, like tiny, little lions."  
05_00804 "Right. Uh well, whatever they are, they're down that tunnel."  
05_00806 "Leggie! Oh no, it's dead."  
05_00807 "Kill the leggie!"  
05_00808 "That's an antlion?"  
05_00809 "Yes. They're leggies."  
05_00810 "Yes! Leggies! And they're bloody deadly, Alyx, be careful!"  
05_00811 "Alyx! Look!"  
05_00813 "I don't understand. All that Vortigaunt energy. If it wasn't holding up the Vault, what was it doing?"  
05_00814 "Well: Vault brought down. That was the tricky part. Now's the easy part: Grab what's inside."  
05_00815 "Fair enough. Well. Let's go do the easy part: grabbing what's inside. Eli? What's inside?"  
05_00816 "A Strider. Deactivated, though. Lucky break there. Could you imagine that thing blocking your way?"  
05_00817 "Alyx! The Strider! Look out, it's alive!"  
05_00818 "Argh. I did jinx us, didn't I?"  
05_00819 "Agh!"  
05_00820 "Ahh."  
05_00821 "Do you uh, think it's dead?"  
05_00822 "I think I've got an idea."  
05_00823 "Get it! Get at it! Shoot it! Shoot it!"  
05_00824 "Ha! It's working! I think it's working. It doesn't look happy about getting shot, anyway. Keep shooting it!"  
05_00825 "Go, go, yes! Yes! Keep shooting! That's the way! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Oh yes!"  
05_00830 "What … why?"  
05_00831 "Oh! Your dad's back!"  
05_00836 "Did you see where it went?"  
05_00837 "I think it's on the hood of that car, there."  
05_00838 "Should be somewhere on the ground there."  
05_00839 "Right! Heading back to the comm room."  
05_00843 "Here you go!"  
05_00844 "Heads up!"  
05_00845 "There you go!"  
05_00846 "Hey, that's my window! Watch it!"  
05_00900 "No, nothing. It's all about sending reinforcements into the Quarantine Zone."  
05_00901 "And on the downside…"  
05_00902 "Yeah, no, I-I know. I've just never seen those before."  
05_00903 "So much pressure in fact that I… Well, I hesitate to even bring up. But I did notice when you reached out for your father's hand, had he actually grabbed it, his grip would have crushed all the delicate sensors in the \"Russells.\""  
05_00904 "Totally understandable … and would have been worth it, by the way … in this case."  
05_00905 "Having said that, I have a hard time imagining ANOTHER situation where that would have been the case. And uh, much like your father, the Russells ARE priceless, okay, so… just… you know, moving forward."  
05_00907 "We can take a shortcut through that building."  
05_00909 "Woooo!"  
05_00910 "I'm recording it, Alyx! Don't look away! Look directly at it for posterity!"  
05_00914 "Well, keep an eye out. There's no shortage of dead folks around here, and … well, not to put too fine a point on it, but they don't need their ammo anymore."  
05_00917 "Great. Now put it on the map."  
05_00919 "Aah!"  
05_00925 "It looks as if there are Combine barricades up ahead. They're stopping anyone from getting any closer to the Vault."  
05_01000 "Alyx! Look up!"  
05_01001 "Look up, look up!"  
05_01002 "Look who's back! I got the drone up and running again!"  
05_01003 "Ignore that. We'll meet you outside."  
05_01004 "Oh, no worries, more ammo where that came from. "  
05_01006 "Just to let you know, though, uhhh… not infinite supplies up here. Okay? Just as a… cautionary warning there."  
05_02000 "And not only that. Someone's hacked into the Combine construction network."  
05_02001 "One minute and I'm out. Guaranteed."  
05_02002 "I think it landed on the hood of the car there."  
05_02003 "That's the brand name, Alyx."  
05_02004 "Yeah, you know, the catchy household name. I'm gonna make a fortune off these things once we get the Combine off Earth and things are back to normal."  
05_02006 "A Vort! It's a Vort!"  
05_02009 "Anything look like a breaker box in there?"  
05_02010 "Well, it is spores from another dimension, so… probably… yeah, extremely."  
05_02011 "But! A rare opportunity to examine alien flora up close."  
05_02012 "Oh! Careful of those pustule things!"  
05_02013 "They're looking a bit ticked off the closer you get."  
05_02014 "Ugh."  
05_02015 "Agreed. Just keep moving."  
05_02016 "Maybe breathe less."  
05_02017 "Alyx, what does it feel like?"  
05_02018 "How'd that feel?"  
05_02019 "How sharp?"  
05_02021 "Okay, six."  
05_02022 "\[Signal Noise\] Alyx! Alyx! What happened?"  
05_02023 "\[Intermittent Signal Noise\] Alyx? Alyx, come in."  
05_02024 "Ah, I'm sorry I missed that."  
05_02025 "Ooh, look at that. Huh. Interesting."  
05_02026 "Be careful, Alyx!"  
05_02027 "No!"  
05_02028 "It sounds nuts."  
05_02029 "Those Combine shield doors are effectively impa … \[Signal Dissolving\]"  
05_02030 "\[Signal Noise\] Alyx! Is the dog gone? What happened?"  
05_02031 "\[Signal Noise\] Did that dog come back again, Alyx?"  
05_02032 "You're alright, though, right?"  
05_02033 "Well we've gotta get you out of here and up to the roof."  
05_02034 "Ah, thank heavens."  
05_02038 "Yeah, you're going to have to get past this Combine wall."  
05_02040 "Looks like they're… milking the leggies…"  
05_02045 "No, no no no, absolutely not. Why, were you considering it?"  
05_02047 "Look, don't waste your ammo! You'll never put a dent in that thing."  
05_02058 "Alright, I'll be able to stop the train right here."  
05_02059 "Absolutely. You just need to activate the terminal."  
05_02060 "Then you'll need to be ready for a fight. They're not gonna give up your dad easily."  
05_02061 "Right. That's the terminal there."  
05_02062 "Do hurry, though."  
05_02063 "Okay, no worries, but the train is coming."  
05_02064 "Just get me in, it'll only take a second. You're doing great."  
05_02065 "Okay! Now just re-engage the system."  
05_02067 "Yes, but I am! We need to find another way to stop this train!"  
05_02068 "Good! Mystery lever! I love it!"  
05_02069 "What's it do?"  
05_02070 "Oh. So Eli's train will be redirected to…"  
05_02071 "Right! Oh yes! He's in a prisoner pod! He'll be fine! Hurry, Alyx!"  
05_02073 "Well, start looking! We don't have much time!"  
05_02074 "Pull it! See what it does!"  
05_02076 "I'll let you know if he gets here … Ah, WHEN. When he gets here."  
05_02082 "Well, when it comes to Combine data encryption…"  
05_02083 "…Eli's your guy!"  
05_02084 "Systems, robotics, networks… I can make short work of those."  
05_02085 "Might as well be an alien language. Well, it is an alien language. Anyway look, Eli's your guy."  
05_02087 "Good luck trying to lock out someone wielding an \"Alyx.\""  
05_02092 "Oh! Let me see! Eli! The Vorts just took down the last substation!"  
05_02093 "It's … they've activated some sort of emergency backup."  
05_02094 "They've activated a backup!"  
05_02095 "Your dad says … "  
05_02106 "The Vault's right there. Just go in and get him. Or what's left of him."  
05_02107 "Bless you."  
05_02200 "Your what?"  
05_02201 "Alyx, that thing's incredible! You need an incredible brand name! Something that really sells it!"  
05_02202 "The Combine's not going to be here forever. You should be thinking about the future, Alyx!"  
05_02203 "Hmm. It's a little derivative of the \"Russells,\" but yeah… Provisionally, sure, the \"Alyx.\""  
05_02204 "Ha ha! There we go. Finally."  
05_02206 "Right! Yes! He's in a prisoner pod! He'll be fine!"  
05_02207 "Hold it down! Keep it held!"  
05_02208 "\[Signal Noise\] Hmm. That was weird."  
05_02209 "Let's try and get that power back on."  
05_02210 "This hotel's ancient. The wiring's gonna be a real rat's nest."  
05_02211 "What the hell is that?!"  
05_02212 "Oh. That's Jeff. I do not like Jeff."  
05_02213 "Oh. Okay. Right … I don't like Jeff."  
05_02214 "That's okay. You could pick some up on the way back."  
05_02215 "I do. But you do have two hands. Could you pick up a SECOND on the way back?"  
05_02216 "Right. That's gotta be the backup station."  
05_02217 "What's that, Alyx?"  
05_02218 "Whoa."  
05_02219 "Absolutely. Be specific."  
05_02220 "Right. Well, to make a club sandwich, you needed to start with bread. Not from a breadline, from a bakery."  
05_02221 "You're welcome, Alyx."  
05_02222 "Yeah?"  
05_02223 "About what?"  
05_02224 "Well, I think that given our situation, your irrational fear of the dark is actually quite appropriate. You know, I can give you easily a hundred reasons to be terrified."  
05_02228 "You should have plenty of time to get the override back online."  
05_02229 "That's not Combine. Maybe a scavenger? Be careful."  
05_02230 "Eli, come here!"  
05_02231 "Eli! Come here!"  
05_02232 "Survived Black Mesa… then disappeared… Eli! They DO have a superweapon!"  
05_02233 "This is… this is a miracle."  
05_02234 "Me too."  
05_02235 "Well, he saved humanity once. I'm willing to bet he can do it again."  
05_02236 "I see it … we're almost there."  
05_02237 "Almost certainly. Just pick one. Immediately."  
05_02238 "No… not that one."  
05_02239 "No, that's not the bridge."  
05_02240 "Alyx, the bridge isn't moving. Why is the bridge not moving?"  
05_02241 "Nope."  
05_02242 "Worse nope."  
05_02243 "Oh God."  
05_02244 "Alyx… Alyx…"  
05_02245 "Alyx… ALYX… ALYX!"  
05_02246 "I'm talking \"right now\" immediately."  
05_02247 "Now, Alyx."  
05_02248 "Alyx, please, just pick one."  
05_02249 "Likewise! Ah, this is great."  
05_02250 "Honestly, I'd pegged your survival at about four percent."  
05_02251 "Yep, it's right over there."  
05_02252 "What is it?"  
05_02259 "If I was the Combine, where would I put a control panel?"  
05_02260 "Oh! A health station."  
05_02261 "Ah yeah, I use them all the time."  
05_02262 "Yeah, they're great."  
05_02263 "Just put your hand in there."  
05_02264 "Look, honestly, just pull the handle and put your hand in there."  
05_02265 "Yeah, I use them all the time. Just find a power cell."  
05_02266 "Alright my friend, you are good to go."  
05_02267 "Alyx! Manhack! Watch out!"  
05_02268 "Manhack!"  
05_02269 "Oop, manhacks!"  
05_02271 "Wait, th-that one's… Black Mesa?"  
05_02272 "Worth it."  
05_02273 "So close!"  
05_02274 "Really close that time."  
05_02275 "Yes!"  
05_02276 "Nice throw!"  
05_02277 "Well done!"  
05_02278 "Yeah, she sounds like she means business."  
05_02279 ""Cooperate.\" Pthhbbt."  
05_02281 "Yeah, we did. We did it."  
05_02290 "Oof. Alright, Alyx. That tractor beam over there looks like it'll get you up to the Vault."  
05_02291 "\[Signal Dissolving\] Argh. It…s throwing off a lot of interference. Probably won…t be able to talk to you in there."  
05_02292 "\[Signal Dissolving\] So this is it."  
05_02293 "\[Signal Dissolving\] Then you'll come back out, with Gordon, safe and sound, so everything is going to be …"  
05_03000 "Brace yourself, Alyx! It's going to come down!"  
05_03001 "What now?"  
05_03500 "Wow! My gun's looking pretty good!"  
05_03501 "Oh wow, check it out! My gun just keeps getting better and better."  
05_03502 "Hmm. I'll tell you what: Let's put that idea on hold for now. We can chat about MY gun when you get back."  
05_03503 "Alright. Fair enough. You earned it. I still want those \"Russells\" back, though."  
05_04001 "Do you hear that?"  
05_04002 "Hurry up and load that thing, it's getting louder!"  
05_04003 "I love this gun."  
05_04500 "Oh. Uh … do you need a minute? 'Cause uh, I mean, I could … I could pause the feed…"  
05_04501 "What do you suppose this is?"  
05_04502 "Oh, crap."  
05_04503 "Oh, just so you know … the Russells have a built-in display. Shows your resin, ammo. You know, might come in handy."  
05_04504 "Yeah, be careful."  
05_04505 "Alyx! Behind that door! I think it's a Combine fabricator!"  
05_04506 "Oh! That should come in handy."  
05_04507 "Well. That was worth the resin."  
05_04508 "The Combine do know how to upgrade a gun. I'll give 'em that."  
05_04509 "You can put that to good use."  
05_04510 "Now that… will be useful."  
05_04512 "Looking very deadly."  
05_04513 "Very nice. I almost wish I was there so I could have a go with that."  
05_04514 "Probably only one of those."  
05_04515 "Okay, two. Two of those."  
05_04517 "Ahh, health station!"  
05_04518 "Hm. It's not working."  
05_04519 "That there is a \"floppy disk.\" We used to store information on them. With magnets, if you can believe it."  
05_04520 "Specifically, two micrometers magnetic iron oxide, three micrometers barium ferrite, and one point two … "  
05_04521 "I'm reading it here on my computer. I downloaded the internet before the war."  
05_04522 "Ehh, most of it."  
05_04523 "Everything alright?"  
05_04524 "Whoa! Careful! Careful!"  
05_04525 "Steady…"  
05_04527 "Yeah, there must be a battery around here somewhere."  
05_04528 "The override has to be outside, Alyx! Hurry!"  
05_04529 "Look for a switch!"  
05_04530 "Keep looking for a switch! We've got to stop that train!"  
05_04531 "You know, if we can get this weapon, we could change things forever."  
05_04532 "Look, I know we've only been working together for a few hours now, but … I want you to know I'm proud of you. Okay? You're under a lot of pressure here."  
05_04533 "\[Chuckles\]"  
05_04534 "Hey! On the monitor. Combine."  
05_04535 "Oh God. Don't look down. Don't look down!"  
05_04536 "Listen, there should be a big tunnel-sized plug in the floor there somewhere. That's gonna be … "  
05_04537 "Correct. You get it open, I'll figure out where it leads."  
05_04538 "Okay, the coast is clear. Time to get that plug open so we can get out through those tunnels."  
05_04539 "Try and find a console."  
05_04540 "Look for a blinking light."  
05_04541 "Honestly, if there's a gorilla on the loose I'm not sure a headcrab's gonna make it much worse."  
05_04542 "Alyx, dead ahead. Those controls dock the Vault to the station."  
05_04546 "Oh, really? What does it reek like? Be specific."  
05_04553 "But what if it cures cancer?"  
05_04554 "What if it gives you a new type of cancer?"  
05_04555 "Fine."  
05_04560 "Too dark. You'll need a flashlight."  
05_04561 "Nicely done."  
05_04562 "Good job."  
05_04563 "Aaand there we go."  
05_04564 "That's it."  
05_04565 "Uh huh. Perfect."  
05_04566 "Okay. Made quick work of that."  
05_04567 "That did it."  
05_04568 "That seemed to work."  
05_04569 "There you go."  
05_04599 "Maybe it's missing a piece?"  
05_04600 "Right. Look for the prisoner transport car. It should be towards the front of the train."  
05_04670 "Well done."  
05_04671 "Keep looking."  
05_04672 "Must be around here somewhere."  
05_04674 "You see anything? I can't see anything."  
05_04675 "It must be here."  
05_04676 "Careful…"  
05_04678 "One down."  
05_04679 "You've almost got it."  
05_04681 "Almost hacked…"  
05_09990 "Look, I really do."  
05_09991 "Two bottles!"  
05_09993 "Three bottles!"  
05_09994 "Oh, you have gone above and beyond with what you've got there. It's reckless, excessive… and deeply appreciated."  
05_20110 "Go look outside! There HAS to be a manual override. Well, technically there doesn't have to be one. But, you know, it'd be nice if there was. Please. \[Chuckles Nervously\]"  
05_20111 "Oh, thank God, a health station."  
05_20112 "Ah!"  
05_94547 "…Mixed… with… ammonia.… Okay."  
05_94599 "It's missing a piece!"  
05_95000 "Excellent choice."  
05_95001 "Smart. That'll come in handy."  
05_95002 "That should win some arguments."  
05_95003 "Wouldn't want to be on the wrong side of that."  
05_95004 "Now that is upgraded."  
05_95005 "That is about as deadly as that thing's gonna get."  
05_95006 "Yeah… that's actually pretty good, isn't it? Heck, I think I gave you the wrong gun."  
05_95007 "They're alien commandos, of course they have automatic weapons."  
05_95008 "We'd have them too but Combine weapons are gene-coded, so, out of luck. Unless! You find one that's unbonded. Or you're open to some minor genetic modification."  
05_95009 "Listen to this..."  
05_95011 "Yeah, that's not good."  
05_95012 "You're gonna have to find the power source for that barrier there."  
05_95013 "There's a Combine Shield blocking your path."  
05_95014 "Well, let's think about it, Alyx. He's on foot, moving at three miles an hour... "  
05_95015 "Plus he's a fugitive, he's only got one leg... There's obstacles, no direct path... Uh, you know what? I'm not gonna lie to you, he SHOULD be back by now."  
05_95016 "Normally, yes. But you're the one headed TOWARDS the danger, so I'd say we should be the ones worried about you."  
05_95017 "Alyx! It's your lucky day! That Combine weapon's unbonded!"  
05_95018 "It's still in the case! They never leave them in the case."  
05_95019 "I didn't even need to edit your genetic code."  
05_95020 "It's okay, there'll be a next time."  
05_95021 "Incoming, Alyx!"  
05_95022 "Got him."  
05_95023 "You okay?"  
05_95024 "Yeahhh, no, I would probably die instantly."  
05_95025 "Fairview Junction! We're here!"  
05_95026 "This is it!"  
05_95027 "Get down!"  
05_95028 ""Flight of the Bumblebee\"."  
05_95029 "That's it!"  
05_95030 "Now just snip those cables and off we go."  
05_95031 "Maybe try opening the cable shielding and shooting them."  
05_95032 "There you go!"  
05_95033 "Incoming!"  
05_95034 "Incoming, Alyx!"  
05_95035 "Combine!"  
05_95036 "Alyx, look out!"  
05_95037 "Yeah, that's right."  
05_95038 "And it, not unlike yourself, is also sensitive to the dark."  
05_95039 "Meaning it should go on automatically when the lights go out."  
05_95040 "Ah, well you know what they say about resin, Alyx."  
05_95041 "Um. \"Look… for… m-more resin.\""  
05_95042 "Yeah, that's the one… \"Look for more resin.\""  
05_95043 "Ooh, that really worked didn't it? Huh…"  
05_95044 "That's a good question…"  
05_95045 "Hmm. I think they're gonna move him off world."  
05_95046 "Oh, you mean Gordon Freeman's crowbar?"  
05_95047 "Oh Alyx, he fought his way out of Black Mesa with nothing BUT that crowbar."  
05_95048 "It's true! Well, it's true that that's what they say. You know, nobody knows for sure."  
05_95049 "Yes! Uh … not mine. I'm out of the gun lending business, mmkay?"  
05_95050 "Yes! Not mine, though."  
05_95051 "What's going o …"  
05_95052 "Ah, h-he's fine, Alyx. He's working away over there."  
05_95053 "Oh… he IS missing a leg, though."  
05_95054 "Right. Well, it's … it's still gone."  
05_95055 "Sure thing."  
05_95056 "Ah, your dad's heads-down. He's working on it. He's got to be close."  
05_95057 "Great job, Alyx. They're throwing everything they've got at you."  
05_95060 "They're alien commandos, of course they have automatic weapons."  
05_95061 "We'd have them too, but Combine weapons are gene-coded, so, you know, we're out of luck. Unless you find one that's unbonded. Or you're open to some minor genetic modification."  
05_99000 "Alyx, we're getting close to the vault, now. You're not going to have many more chances to use your resin."  
05_99001 "I can't believe my pistol's made it this far."  
05_99002 "No, you're trying to rile me up. I won't fall for it. But in case you're not, give him the shotgun. Legend has it he's absolutely mental with a shotgun."  
05_99003 "Alyx? Alyx, you still there?"  
05_99004 "Alyx? Alyx?"  
05_99005 "Alyx? ALYX!"  
05_99006 "ALYX!"  
05_99007 "Agh! Headcrab! A headcrab's on your face! Get it off your face, Alyx!"  
05_99009 "Ohhh, it's really on there!"  
05_99010 "Grab it! Hit it!"  
05_99011 "Hit it, Alyx! Knock it off your face!"  
05_99012 "Oh, thank God…"  
05_99013 "It was on your face and it… ugh, it was disgusting."  
05_99900 "Just point your hand at something."  
05_99901 "Find something to target with the \"Russells.\""  
05_99902 "Now target something with the \"Russells.\""  
05_99903 "Use your hand to target something."  
05_99904 "All you've got to do is point your hand at something."  
05_99905 "Just point at something with your hand to target."  
05_99906 "Find an object and aim your hand at it."  
05_99908 "Alyx!"

06_00001 "The Alyx Vance! \[Chuckles\]"  
06_00002 "You received my messages!"  
06_00003 "Come! Enter."  
06_00004 "You are welcome!"  
06_00005 "Cooking!"  
06_00006 "I have a brain injury."  
06_00007 "My brain is injured!"  
06_00008 "Ow."  
06_00009 "The…"  
06_00010 "…Eli Vance!"  
06_00011 "Yes."  
06_00012 "The Combine. Yes. Do not go yet! I must show you something!"  
06_00013 "This way!"  
06_00014 "It is important!"  
06_00015 "The Alyx Vance must go this way anyway…"  
06_00016 "The Combine have other of my kin."  
06_00017 "Held, like the Eli Vance."  
06_00018 "The Alyx Vance will free them!"  
06_00019 "You will not save him. He is dead."  
06_00020 "Or he will be…"  
06_00021 "It is a matter of perspective. But Alyx Vance alone cannot prevent his fate."  
06_00022 "No riddles! The Combine drilled here. I do not know when I am. I am severed from the Vortessence. I am alone in my head."  
06_00023 "You have saved my kin!"  
06_00024 "Then you will! Courage, Alyx Vance!"  
06_00025 "I will help the Alyx Vance! Look to the Northern Star."  
06_00026 "For guidance!"  
06_00027 "I am not! Here."  
06_00028 "Sustenance!"  
06_00029 "You will be welcome."  
06_00030 "Come in, come in!"  
06_00031 "Enter, Alyx Vance."  
06_00032 "Your journey brings you this far. Just a little farther, perhaps. "  
06_00033 "I have been waiting for you, Alyx Vance."  
06_00034 "In here!"  
06_00035 "I must show you why I've brought you here."  
06_00036 "Through there, Alyx Vance."  
06_00037 "You must go!"  
06_00038 "Your mission begins, Alyx Vance."  
06_00039 "Go!"  
06_00040 "The Eli Vance! The Alyx Vance! I am here to help as I said I would. Go! I will ensure your father's safety."  
06_00042 "\[Grunting\]"  
06_00043 "I will lead the Eli Vance to safety."  
06_00045 "Then you will."

06_00054 "\[Sniffs\] Mmm! "  
06_00055 "\[Hums Contentedly\]"  
06_00056 "Yes, creature."  
06_00057 "\[Channelling Vortessence\]"  
06_00058 "Hrrmm… ah… mmmhmm… interesting… ah, excellent… "  
06_00063 "We have been in trapped… in the dark."  
06_00064 "The Alyx Vance… you are our friend."  
06_00065 "The Combine drain from us the power they use to protect their weapon."  
06_00066 "…We are ripped from ourselves."  
06_00067 "No… the Vortigaunt will extract ourselves and exact our own vengeance. YOU must go to the weapon."  
06_00068 "Do not worry, Alyx Vance. They will not be. We will not allow it."  
06_00072 "Now, go! We each have our paths. We cannot fail."  
06_00073 "There…"  
06_00074 "There…"  
06_00075 "There…"  
06_00076 "There…"  
06_00078 "\[Gasps\]"  
06_00080 "\[Groans\]"  
06_00081 "What they do to us all."  
06_00082 "\[Channelling Vortessence\]"  
06_00100 "\[Gasping\]"  
06_00101 "I must show the Alyx Vance."  
06_00102 "Come!"  
06_00103 "Look here!"  
06_00104 "The Alyx Vance must come."  
06_00105 "Please, come."  
06_00106 "I will clear the path."  
06_00107 "Go. Our paths diverge. But remember: There is no distance between us. We are coterminous."  
06_00109 "I am diminished. The Vortessence is distant from me… I hear its song, but faintly."  
06_00115 "\[Chuckles\]"  
06_00200 "Alyx Vance! I have come to help, as I said I would."  
06_00201 "Look to the Northern Star…"  
06_00202 "I will accompany the Eli Vance and ensure his safety!"  
06_00203 "No riddles! The Combine drilled here. I am severed from the Vortessence. I am alone in my head."  
06_00206 "I love you too!"  
06_00208 "\[Channelling Vortessence\]"  
06_00210 "\[Channelling Vortessence\]"
