01_01152 "Wait. Wait. Where's Dad?"  
01_01153 "Okay, got it."  
01_01154 "So… Dad's okay, right?"  
01_01155 "But …"  
01_01156 "…And you saved me?"  
01_01157 "Do we know where they're taking him?"  
01_01161 "Ready."  
01_01162 "Hm. Didn't work."  
01_01163 "Still not working."  
01_01164 "Uh uh."  
01_01165 "Nope."  
01_01166 "How's that?"  
01_01171 "Thanks, Russell."  
01_01172 "I know."  
01_01173 "Oh!"  
01_01174 "I did?"  
01_01176 "So, what's a Vortigaunt doing here?"  
01_01177 "Right, but I mean in general."  
01_01178 "Oh. I'm sorry to …"  
01_01180 "…Eli Vance…"  
01_01181 "The Combine have him, and I really do need to get moving."  
01_01182 "Look, I appreciate …"  
01_01183 "I can't stick around, I …"  
01_01184 "I'm sure it is, but …"  
01_01185 "Okay."  
01_01186 "I would help. I really would. But the Alyx Vance is honestly very busy saving her Dad."  
01_01187 "What?"  
01_01188 "Is? Or will be?"  
01_01190 "I'm sorry."  
01_01192 "I… haven't."  
01_01193 "Why?"  
01_01194 "Okay. Thanks. Are you done? Helping?"  
01_01195 "Uh… I'll eat it later. Thanks for the help."  
01_01197 "What'd you…?"  
01_01198 "Okay…"  
01_01199 "Thanks."  
01_01200 "Whoa whoa whoa whoa, waitwaitwait! I just… I just live here!"  
01_01201 "Hey! Wait wait no no no n …"  
01_01205 "Russell… what did you guys find back there?"  
01_01206 "The Citadel?"  
01_01207 "Russell? Just hang on, I'm almost there."  
01_05500 "Alright, it looks like the bridge is fully extended…"  
01_055003 "Okay, well, one of these has to bring in the vault for docking, right? Right?"  
01_055004 "Um. That's not it."  
01_055005 "Oooh, kay, definitely not."  
01_055006 "Maybe?!"  
01_055007 "That doesn't look good… Ugh!"  
01_05501 "Just need to GENTLY dock the vault TO the bridge."  
01_05502 "How hard can that be?"  
01_05508 "Keep what in?"  
01_11107 "Uh, sure. Yeah. I'll be there in a minute."  
01_11108 "Nope. It exploded. I'm fine, by the way."  
01_11110 "Russell. They've got Dad."  
01_11111 "Oh God…"  
01_11112 "Which is…?"  
01_11113 "Great. Let's hear it."  
01_11114 "Russell."  
01_11115 "Stop."  
01_11116 "And if he gets on that train… that's it, right?"  
01_11117 "I thought you said \"us.\""  
01_11119 "Okay."  
01_11121 ""Russells\"?"  
01_11122 "Got it."  
01_11126 "I'm already headed out on foot."  
01_11127 "Then I'm headed on foot."  
01_11131 "Thanks, Russell."  
01_11132 "Tell you what, Russell. If I die, I owe you a gun."  
01_11133 "I got a dead zombie here. I-I thought the Combine sealed up the QZ?"  
01_11134 "Probably not a one-off, then."  
01_11135 "Oof, they're gross."  
01_11140 "Hey, Russell. I just found a loose syringe of God knows what. Is this medicine?"  
01_11141 "I don't see one."  
01_11142 "I feel GREAT."  
01_11143 "I take it the Quarantine Zone is behind this hatch?"  
01_11144 "I'll look around for a control panel to open it up."  
01_11145 "I'm gonna head in. How far is Fairview Junction?"  
01_11146 "Have they started moving Dad yet?"  
01_11147 "Oh, that's great."  
01_11148 "Mm-hmm."  
01_11155 "So when did you start calling the gravity gloves the \"Russells\"?"  
01_11164 "How'd you meet my Dad, anyway? You guys worked together at Black Mesa, right?"  
01_11167 "Russell. Russell … I didn't eat it."  
01_11188 "Um, nope. Not once."  
01_11189 "You guys had all that? That's insane."  
01_11190 "Wow!"  
01_11191 "Yeah, you sure do."  
01_11194 "That is… Wow."  
01_11300 "Wait w-wait wait! Don't shoot!"  
01_11301 "DAD!"  
01_11305 "Whoa."  
01_11306 "Yeah, what happened?"  
01_11309 "Oof. I think that's the last of them."  
01_11310 "Got it!"  
01_11313 "Is it supposed to come off?!"  
01_11314 "W-w-what do I do…  What do I do now?!"  
01_11315 "I'm not panicking!"  
01_11322 "It won't stay!"  
01_11323 "Got it!"  
01_11325 "Holy crap!"  
01_11326 "Train train train train TRAIN!"  
01_11327 "I'm okay. Let's go find Dad."  
01_11336 "How do you know all of this?"  
01_11337 "Hey, how do I disconnect the cables?"  
01_11338 "Yep."  
01_11339 "I'm going to open it up and deactivate it."  
01_11340 "You're free now. It's okay, your friend sent me."  
01_11341 "What are they doing to you here?"  
01_11344 "We have to stop them from killing your friends."  
01_11345 "I can't get into the Vault if the substations are still online."  
01_11382 "Which means?"  
01_11400 "Gotta go."  
01_11401 "Let's talk later."  
01_11402 "Hold on, I gotta go."  
01_11403 "Russell, I gotta go."  
01_11404 "Later, gotta go."  
01_11405 "Hold on, I'm busy."  
01_11406 "Hold on, I got company."  
01_11407 "Crap, Combine."  
01_11408 "Russell!"  
01_11409 "It's good, Dad. Metro Cop movement is normal. Same for the Combine patrols. How's it going in the stockyard?"  
01_11413 "I see it!"  
01_11415 "Ahh!"  
01_11416 "What is that?"  
01_11417 "Oh boy."  
01_11418 "No shortcut?"  
01_11419 "Well… let's take the long way."  
01_11420 "Oh, man."  
01_11421 "Thanks. You know, for all your talk about what a \"lesser\" gun this is, this thing isn't half bad."  
01_11423 "Russell, are you seeing this?"  
01_11424 "It looks like it's just… cardboard."  
01_11425 "Yeah. Weird, though."  
01_11426 "I'm fine, Russell, what's up?"  
01_11427 "Russell? Russell! Crap."  
01_11428 "I … Look. Thank you for… everything. But I really have to go. And I'm sorry, but I really don't have time for riddles."  
01_11429 "Look, if I can, if I run across your friends, I will see what I can do."  
01_11434 "Yeah. IF."  
01_11435 "Wow. Russ."  
01_11447 "Well, you asked."  
01_11448 "Where… where are we?"  
01_11449 "What? Unless WHAT?"  
01_11456 "You know, Russell; Now that I'm walking into the Quarantine Zone… It just hit me. I don't know any thing about the Quarantine Zone."  
01_11457 "Alllright. Cool."  
01_11458 "You downloaded the entire Internet."  
01_11459 "Nice."  
01_11462 "NOW it's gonna get weird?"  
01_11465 "Okay, I'm bracing myself."  
01_11467 "I think… I think I killed all the aliens. I think they're all dead now."  
01_11468 "Now we just gotta get to the vault, get the weapon, kick the Combine off Earth … super easy … and they're … and there's sandwiches, there's gonna be sandwiches…"  
01_11469 "Good. I hope they're good."  
01_11474 "Okay, so: Right now, what it's like to live on Earth, on a scale of one to ten … I'd say we're at a two."  
01_11475 "What would you rate it BEFORE the Combine showed up?"  
01_11476 "Six? That's not great."  
01_11477 "Well, maybe we get the Combine off Earth and we could shoot for like an eight, you know?"  
01_11478 "So when we get the Combine off of earth, what are you going to do?"  
01_11479 "Oh, of course! You'll be sitting on a landmine!"  
01_11480 "So… this whole three year Russell plan… you think, uh… you think you'd have a job for me?"  
01_11481 "We could be partners."  
01_11482 "I don't know what any of that meant, but it sounds good, partner."  
01_11483 "Umm… uh, well, Dad and I would get a house and help rebuild, you know? And then I'd, you know probably start a secret lab."  
01_11484 "Well, yeah. So I'd start my lab and I wouldn't even need locks, or doors, or windows that close!"  
01_11485 "Ohhh. Pfft, right."  
01_11600 "Oh my God. Where's Dad?"  
01_11601 "Dad? DAD?"  
01_11602 "Dad!"  
01_11603 "I'm coming!"  
01_11605 "I'll be right there! One sec!"  
01_11607 "Okay. I'm going to reach out and pull you up. It's gonna be okay. You ready?"  
01_11608 "Give me your hand!"  
01_11609 "DAD!"  
01_11610 "\[Shocked Gasp\]"  
01_11611 "Thank you, oh my God, thank you! Dad, stay there! I'm gonna figure out how to get down to you!"  
01_11612 "A superweapon?"  
01_11613 "Then we've gotta steal it before they do!"  
01_11614 "So what's the plan?"  
01_11615 "Dad! Where's the vault?"  
01_11616 "I… yes. Look to the star. Got it. Dad?"  
01_11617 "Great! Thank you."  
01_11618 "I love you too!"  
01_11619 "Gotta go."  
01_12005 "Whoa!"  
01_12006 "AH!"  
01_12007 "HOLY!"  
01_12008 "GAH!"  
01_12009 "J-J-OH GOD"  
01_12011 "Alright, fair enough."  
01_12012 "Got it. Will it work on the Russells?"  
01_12020 "Ngh! It's on my face! On my face!"  
01_12021 "Oh my God, OH MY GOD… ON MY… OH GOD NO"  
01_12022 "Agh! Get off! Get off!"  
01_12023 "\[Straining, Gasping for Breath\]"  
01_12024 "I…m trying!"  
01_12028 "Yeah. It was."  
01_12040 "Any news on Dad?"  
01_12041 "Heard anything about Dad, Russell?"  
01_12042 "Damnit."  
01_12043 "How is that good news?"  
01_12044 "I'll take it."  
01_12045 "How do you know that?"  
01_12046 "Russell! I'm good! How's Dad?"  
01_12047 "I'm working on it."  
01_12048 "You're not gonna believe this, but I ran into a Vortigaunt."  
01_12049 "Hiding. I think he escaped from the Combine."  
01_12050 "You ever meet a Vortigaunt? He said crazy Vortigaunt stuff."  
01_12051 "Oh, that Vortigaunt I met? He did give me a headcrab to eat."  
01_12052 "The Combine off Earth. I want the Combine off Earth."  
01_12055 "I don't know. But we need to find Dad."  
01_12056 "You know … it got a bit messy back there, but we did get Dad back."  
01_12057 "What?"  
01_12058 "Holy crap. That's gotta be the Vault."  
01_12059 "So even if we MAKE it there, we still have to get UP to it."  
01_12060 "And break whatever's at the other end."  
01_12061 "Will I have to look out any windows to bring the Vault down?"  
01_12062 "Then I'm all for it."  
01_12066 ""Look to the Northern Star…\""  
01_12067 "No, no … the Vortigaunt said \"Look to the Northern Star\" to help his friends. Which sounds like Vortigaunt nonsense, but I guess it isn't."  
01_12068 "Like the power and security you'd need for a giant vault."  
01_12069 "And… there's the vault."  
01_12070 "I can't figure out how to get into this thing."  
01_12071 "Russell? You're breaking up again."  
01_12072 "I'll use a little bit of technology I like to call \"the stairs.\""  
01_12073 "Nevermind, I won't be using the stairs."  
01_12080 "Getting kinda crowded down here, Russ."  
01_12081 "Well, now I just want it more."  
01_12082 "I… I trust him."  
01_12083 "Russ. Trusting him is… our only plan here. He'll do this. We can do this."  
01_12084 "Well, it's huge so it shouldn't be hard to know which way I'm going."  
01_12085 "I don't understand what they're doing with it, here."  
01_12086 "If this weapon is so powerful, why keep it locked up in a dump like this?"  
01_12087 "Why not use it HERE?"  
01_12088 "Are you SEEING that?!"  
01_12089 "What is it?"  
01_12090 "Yes!"  
01_12091 "It better."  
01_12092 "Okay. So, what do you think?"  
01_12093 "Okay, I don't see a way into this building, so I'm going to look around."  
01_12094 "What is this place, anyway?"  
01_12095 "Is… vodka… good?"  
01_12096 "Russell doesn't like vodka, got it."  
01_12097 "But it's not good?"  
01_12098 "But…"  
01_12099 "Okay, that's all very confusing."  
01_12100 "There's definitely a bunch of old bottles in here. Does alcohol go bad?"  
01_12101 "Russell? You're breaking up."  
01_12102 "Well, oh well."  
01_12103 "Hey, Russ. Vortigaunts just took down another one."  
01_12104 "Russ! The Vorts are taking down another substation!"  
01_12105 "Russ? Ugh."  
01_12107 "More or less … you're breaking up."  
01_12108 "I made a friend named Jeff."  
01_12109 "Yeah, we're not really close."  
01_12110 "The Combine sealed up the exit in here. I'm getting it back open and getting outta here."  
01_12111 "I-I can't hear you. Russell!"  
01_12113 "Great. Also, little heads up, I think the tunnel is full of antlions, just in case I cut out permanently."  
01_12114 "Yeah, you know. Aliens with stabby legs."  
01_12115 "…No."  
01_12116 "No, that's not them. These ones are pretty dangerous."  
01_12117 "Yep. Off I go."  
01_12123 "WHAT?!"  
01_12124 "That's an antlion, Russell."  
01_12125 "Yes. So you DO know what antlions are."  
01_12126 "That's the last substation! He did it!"  
01_12128 "Guys. Can we figure this out later? That cable stirred up an antlion nest."  
01_12129 "I don't know. But something's keeping it up there. And we're running out of time to find it."  
01_12130 "Great! What is it, Dad?"  
01_12131 "Okay, got it."  
01_12132 "There's cables coming out of it. I think they connect to a power source. I'll get over there and disconnect them. Well. Shoot them."  
01_12134 "Right. What IS inside, anyway?"  
01_12135 "Oh man, Russ, don't jinx me."  
01_12136 "Oh crap. Moving. Moving."  
01_12137 "Textbook! Textbook jinxing, Russell!"  
01_12138 "Agh! Moving. Still moving."  
01_12139 "Gahhh!"  
01_12140 "Ahhh…"  
01_12143 "Russell! Big gun up ahead."  
01_12144 "Yeah, I just had it too."  
01_12145 "I just had it too. And it's a good one."  
01_12146 "I'm shooting it!"  
01_12147 "Russell, lemme shoot!"  
01_12149 "No. Probably not."  
01_12150 "Yeah."  
01_12151 "Everything'll be fine, Russ. Talk to you soon."  
01_12156 "Russell? I'm out."  
01_12157 "Hey, Russell? I, uh… I'm out again."  
01_12158 "Russell? I'm out. Again."  
01_12202 "Alyx! Alyx Vance!"  
01_12203 "Yep! I trapped Jeff in a trash compactor."  
01_12204 "And then I crushed him."  
01_12206 "Alyx! Alyx Vance!"  
01_12600 "Oh! Also … I spotted the Combine moving supplies into the Quarantine Zone. That place has been deserted for years."  
01_12604 "Ahh. Okay."  
01_12605 "Right."  
01_12606 "Russ, I promise, your gloves are safe with me."  
01_12607 "So is vodka any good?"  
01_12608 "Let me figure out how to get in, and then I'll find you some."  
01_12609 "There's no straight shot to the Vault. I'm gonna head inside and find a way around this barricade."  
01_12610 "There's no straight shot to the Vault. I'm gonna head inside and find a way out."  
01_12612 "Got it, thanks."  
01_12613 "\[Coughs\] Got it, thanks."  
01_12614 "Got it, thanks."  
01_12615 "Hooooly crap!"  
01_12616 "Have you heard any Combine chatter about Dad escaping?"  
01_12617 "On the plus side, that means Dad is still on his way back to you. We'd have heard if they'd recaptured Eli Vance."  
01_12618 "Getting to the Vault isn't going to get any easier."  
01_12646 "So… I AM eventually gonna run out of ammo."  
01_12650 "Ahh!"  
01_12651 "Ah!"  
01_12652 "Ahh!"  
01_12654 "Right. So… he's okay, right? He lives. My Dad lives."  
01_12656 "No! I-I-I just want to go home. Send me home!"  
01_12658 "Yep … they got the reactor, easy peasy."  
01_12660 "I'm headed back to the safehouse right now to meet Dad."  
01_12700 "Don't get greedy, guys. We're not made of time here."  
01_12702 "Sounds good. Where's the train I'm taking?"  
01_12703 "Yeah, we are."  
01_12704 "The brand name?"  
01_12706 "That's THE Vort!"  
01_12709 "Nah, I'm still looking."  
01_12710 "Here we go."  
01_12711 "Boom. Power back on."  
01_12712 "Now just have to get the elevator some juice."  
01_12713 "And up we…"  
01_12714 "Hmm."  
01_12715 "This place is overgrown. How dangerous do we think this stuff really is?			"  
01_12716 "I'm really starting to think I shouldn't be breathing this stuff."  
01_12717 "Kinda… slimy? A little tingly."  
01_12718 "Ow."  
01_12719 "Sharp."  
01_12720 "Like a six."  
01_12721 "A strong six."  
01_12722 "Yep. Of course."  
01_12723 "Uh oh, this guy's not wearing a shirt."  
01_12724 "Gotcha."  
01_12725 "Thannnk you."  
01_12726 "Oh, that's not good."  
01_12727 "There was like a… dog-looking… lightning thing."  
01_12728 "I killed it and it crapped out this thing?"  
01_12729 "Hey, Russell. This thing fell out of the dog."  
01_12730 "Ah crap, lightning dog."  
01_12731 "Oh my God, it went into a guy! Russell?"  
01_12732 "New development: It went into a dead guy."  
01_12733 "Yes. I had to shoot both of them, it was NUTS, Russell."  
01_12734 "Oh, it was."  
01_12735 "Uh oh."  
01_12736 "Yeah, oof. This one was… kinda rough."  
01_12737 "Yeah Russ, I'm good."  
01_12738 "I'm working on it."  
01_12739 "Found an elevator up."  
01_12746 "Alright, we're getting close to the substation here."  
01_12747 "I'll figure out how to shut it down."  
01_12748 "Alright … this should turn off that wall."  
01_12749 "Oh man."  
01_12750 "\[Gasps in Surprise\]"  
01_12751 "What do you think they're doing in here?"  
01_12754 "\[Grunts in Pain\]"

01_12756 "\[Grunts in Pain\]"

01_12763 "Ahh!"  
01_12764 "Ahh!"  
01_12765 "Unh!"  
01_12766 "I think you're right."  
01_12767 "It's too dark. I need a flashlight."  
01_12768 "I'll need a flashlight if I want to go in there."  
01_12769 "I'd never survive a jump from this height."  
01_12770 "Nope."  
01_12771 "I don't think so."  
01_12774 "Nope. That'll kill me."  
01_12779 "Ohh. Thank God."  
01_12780 "Ewww."  
01_13000 "Huh, I think I can reroute this with my multi-tool."  
01_13001 "It's a tool with multiple functions. So, you know … multi-tool."  
01_13002 "Who am I gonna sell it to?"  
01_13003 "Well, how about I call it the \"Alyx\"?"  
01_13004 "Yeah, the \"Alyx.\""  
01_13005 "Whoa! Here we go."  
01_13006 "Hey, Russ. Keep an eye out for Dad, okay?"  
01_13007 "Aaaand the power's out."  
01_13008 "Looks like we're taking the stairs."  
01_13009 "Aaaand the stairs are out."  
01_13010 "Ooo, breaker boxes."  
01_13012 "Let's go back to the elevator plan. I'm gonna get the power back on."  
01_13013 "Here we go … breaker boxes."  
01_13014 "Power's back on. Let's check the elevator."  
01_13015 "Argh! Rat's nest."  
01_13016 "Elevator's still not on yet."  
01_13017 "Y'know, this all looks good."  
01_13018 "Maybe we missed something out by the elevator."  
01_13019 "Looks like we're taking the ladder."  
01_13020 "THAT'S Jeff."  
01_13021 "THAT'S Jeff … keep your voice down!"  
01_13022 "He's an acquired taste."  
01_13023 "Ya know Russ, I'm sorry I didn't get you any vodka back there."  
01_13024 "You know, I hope you appreciate how much of a pain in the butt it is carrying this vodka around."  
01_13025 "Wait… Dad… What?!"  
01_13026 "Whoa, okay. So if it's not a weapon, are we still doing this?"  
01_13027 "True…"  
01_13028 "We've come this far, I say we keep going. And if you find out it's something we really shouldn't mess with, we'll call it off."  
01_13029 "So, head towards those beams, right?"  
01_13030 "Nothing, I'm on my way."  
01_13032 "Alright, here we go."  
01_13033 "Whoa, Russell, are you seeing this?"  
01_13035 "Alright, Russ. REALLY need you to talk again."  
01_13036 "Umm… before. What was life like before the Combine?"  
01_13037 "It's really dark… Russ?"  
01_13038 "Can you just… talk?"  
01_13039 "About anything, literally anything."  
01_13040 "Okay, that was my fault. I'll be more specific next time."  
01_13041 "There's somebody up there!"  
01_13042 "Whoa whoa! Shh!"  
01_13043 "Wait… SHH!"  
01_13044 "Shh! Sh-sh-shh Quiet!"  
01_13045 "Oh, wow. That's good, right?"  
01_13046 "Alright. So… let's go save Gordon Freeman."  
01_13047 "Oh. Incoming. Hey, gimme a second."  
01_13048 "Okay, so the plan is to get to that control room and get Gordon. You know, I'll be honest, people talk about him a lot, but I always just assumed he was dead."  
01_13049 "Hey, Dad. Are you there?"  
01_13050 "If Gordon survived Black Mesa… where's he been?"  
01_13051 "Once we get Gordon back, we can really get ambitious, don't you think, Russ? Maybe we could take down the Citadel."  
01_13052 "And this time he won't have to do it alone."  
01_13053 "Yeah, Dad."  
01_13054 "What's the security like inside?"  
01_13055 "I guess I'll have to improvise."  
01_13056 "There's the control room."  
01_13057 "Alright, here we go. Time to go rescue the savior of humanity."  
01_1305862 "Oh God."  
01_13059 "Damn it."  
01_13060 "Now what?"  
01_13061 "Oh! Terrific."  
01_13063 "Okay, okay, well, one of these has gotta extend the bridge… right?"  
01_13064 "Uhhh…"  
01_13065 "THIS one."  
01_13066 "I know, Russ, I can see it not moving."  
01_13067 "Oh God. Oh God… Oh GOD!"  
01_13068 "Ahhh!"  
01_13069 "Russ! Russell! Put Dad on!"  
01_13070 "Dad! We just took down a substation!"  
01_13071 "We will. You've still got that datapod, right?"  
01_13072 "For sure. You go ahead, I'll be fine, Dad … I promise."  
01_13073 "Holy crap, they must've been terrified of this thing."  
01_13086 "Nope. Still looking."  
01_13087 "Russel… the Combine use these. Are they safe for people?"  
01_13088 "Are you sure?"  
01_13089 "Ow! Ow-ow-ow. \[Sucking in Air\]"  
01_13090 "Ahhhhh. Hey…"  
01_13091 "Hey… you were right. These are great."  
01_13092 "Ahhh. Ooh."  
01_13093 "Ahhh. Nice."  
01_13094 "See it!"  
01_13096 "Thanks. Thanks Russell."  
01_13097 "Yeah… When you guys were off stealing the reactor, I saw the Combine moving supplies in here. So, I guess they're interested in this place again."  
01_13098 "What IS that?"  
01_13099 "It looks like pictures of Vortigaunts…"  
01_13100 "Somebody spent a lot of time on this."  
01_13101 "Whoa! More floating cardboard."  
01_13102 "That's weird."  
01_13103 "Just stay there! I'm gonna figure out how to get over to you!"  
01_13104 "Ooo, grenades."  
01_13105 "Ugh. Total waste of a grenade."  
01_13106 "Agreed."  
01_13108 "Heads up, zombie."  
01_13109 "Look out."  
01_13111 "Missed!"  
01_13112 "Dammit!"  
01_13113 "Ugh!"  
01_13114 "Yes!"  
01_13115 "Whoa!"

01_13124 "…I hate you, Jeff…"  
01_13125 "\[Laughing in Relief\] We did it, Russ."  
01_13130 "Got it."  
01_13131 "Whoa! Yeah, okay. I'm going up."  
01_13132 "Dad? Dad?"  
01_13133 "Gordon… Freeman?"  
01_13135 "So… who are you?"  
01_13140 "Phew. Okay."  
01_13141 "Okay."  
01_13142 "Oof…"

01_13203 "Open the damn window!"  
01_13500 "Thanks Russ."  
01_13900 "You know, I hope you appreciate how much of a pain in the butt it is carrying this crate of vodka around."  
01_13901 "Oh, I…m taking one of these for myself."  
01_20000 "\[Grunts in Pain\]"  
01_20001 "Thank you!"

01_20100 "I'm on it."  
01_20101 "I can see that, Russell."  
01_20102 "Yep, doing great, no worries no worries no worries…"  
01_20104 "I saw a lever outside!"  
01_20105 "It switches the tracks!"  
01_20106 "…to a wall."  
01_20108 "I don't know!"  
01_20109 "There's gotta be another way to stop this train…"  
01_20111 "You sure you can do that?"

01_20127 "I'll be ready."  
01_20129 "Yes, WHEN."  
01_20135 "Oh, Dad said he stole some files about this weapon."  
01_20136 "You're my guy?…"  
01_20137 "Oh."  
01_20138 "But not data encryption."

01_20150 "Wait, what the…"  
01_20151 "I heard him."  
01_20152 "I hope whoever is in there is worth it."  
01_20164 "Maybe we'd have lasted eight."  
01_20166 "I'm on my way."  
01_20169 "Phew, thanks."  
01_20170 "Oh. Yeah, definitely. You're gonna want to put that in Year Two."  
01_20173 "Yeah, what is it, Dad?"

01_20280 "Yeuch."  
01_20281 "You see that? Russell? Russell!"  
01_50600 "Russ, come on. At this point it's kind of \"our\" gun."  
01_50601 "You know, Russ … technically? I don't think there's a whole lot of your gun left anymore."  
01_50602 "Well, Russ, it's official. There is NOTHING left of your gun in this gun. This is just… this is MY gun."  
01_50700 "Oh! That zombie has a shotgun!"  
01_50701 "Whoa!"  
01_50702 "Yeah. Let's get this shotgun and get out of here."  
01_50703 "Got it!"

01_70000 "Just looking, Russ."  
01_70002 "I think… it's some kind of lock."  
01_70003 "I think we just got locked in here."  
01_70004 "Got it. Thanks."  
01_70005 "Oh boy…"  
01_70006 "Health station!"  
01_70007 "Ahh. Here, look. It needs power."  
01_70008 "Huh."  
01_70009 "Russell? How do you know all this."  
01_70010 "Whew, it is DARK."  
01_70011 "Nope. I'm good, I'm good."  
01_70012 "Oh, thank God."

01_70024 "Got it."  
01_70025 "Ah. There it is."  
01_70026 "Ah ha."  
01_70027 "I see 'em."  
01_70028 "Russ, you're not even here!"  
01_70029 "There it is, Russ!"  
01_70030 "The tunnel out of here?"  
01_70031 "Russ? Do you think a headcrab could turn a gorilla into a zombie?"  
01_70032 "On it."  
01_70035 "\[Sniffs\] Ugh. This stuff reeks."  
01_70036 "Like a rotting animal mixed with… ammonia."  
01_70043 "What if it GIVES me cancer?"  
01_70044 "Russ, I'm gonna do less touching."  
01_70060 "Russell! These guys have automatic weapons!"  
01_70061 "These guys have automatic weapons."  
01_70063 "I'll keep my fingers crossed on the, uh… option one. Just gonna roll with the genes I'm currently working with."  
01_70064 "That's a lot of words while a lot of bullets are flying at me, Russ!"  
01_70099 "Oh my god, Russ. This ID card has a picture of a skeleton on it."  
01_70500 "Combine!"  
01_70501 "Russ, these guys have automatic weapons."  
01_70503 "I'm… I'm good, Russ. I'm just going to roll with these genes that I've got."  
01_70504 "The more I touch this stuff, the more I think it's probably toxic."  
01_70505 "There it is. That elevator will take me up to the substation."  
01_70506 "Not to be a worrier, but shouldn't Dad be back by now?"  
01_70507 "Yeah. So I should be worried."  
01_70508 "How are you sure?"  
01_70509 "Nice."  
01_70510 "I know. You would've loved that."  
01_70511 "The substation is on the floor above me."  
01_70512 "Alright, there's the substation, I'll get up to the next floor and we'll shut it down."  
01_70605 "Nnngh!"

01_70895 "Whoa, this is weird."  
01_70896 "Wait. Hey, wait, wait, wait!…"  
01_70897 "Russ … what do you think they're doing to Gordon Freeman in there?"  
01_70898 "Are they … you know, sucking his brain out?"  
01_70899 "Well, either way, let's not find out. I'll get there before it happens."  
01_70900 "Russ, what's the deal with the crowbar?"  
01_70901 "Yeah."  
01_70902 "No way."  
01_70903 "Well, when I get him out, let's give him a gun."  
01_70904 "Russ!"  
01_70905 "How's Dad doing? Does he seem okay?"  
01_70906 "Good. Well, thanks."  
01_70907 "Yeah, you know he was missing a leg before."  
01_70908 "Thanks, Russ."  
01_70909 "Hey … Any news on the datapod?"  
01_70910 "Great."

## Eli

02_01103 "Alyx! How's it looking up there?"  
02_01104 "\[Laughs\] One Combine mini-reactor from a shipment of 4000. They're never gonna miss it. Here, see for yourself."  
02_01105 "Hmm. That IS odd. Well, we'll look into it when we get back."  
02_01106 "Meet back at the safehouse, baby. We'll be there soon. What is it, Russell?"  
02_01107 "\[Groaning in Pain\]"  
02_01110 "\[Groaning\]"  
02_01114 "Russell? Where is he? Is he alright?"  
02_01118 "We don't have time. It's a weapon, Alyx! It's what they're hiding in here. It-It's what we found out about and that's why they grabbed us."  
02_01119 "They got it in a vault… a tower, with security all around it."  
02_01120 "There's a substation nearby."  
02_01130 "See? I'll be fine. Now get moving."  
02_01132 "Alyx, whatever this weapon is, you need to either steal it or destroy it."  
02_01136 "\[Chuckling\] I love you, baby."  
02_01216 "I love you, baby!"  
02_01223 "What is it, Russell?"  
02_01300 "We didn't steal anything!"  
02_01301 "No one! I didn't see anyone!"  
02_01350 "Agh! "  
02_01500 "Baby!  "  
02_01502 "I'm over here, honey! I need help, hurry!"  
02_01503 "Baby! Over here!"  
02_01504 "Help me up… help me up…"  
02_01506 "Hurry, baby! Hurry! I'm losing my grip."  
02_01507 "\[Groaning in Pain\]"  
02_01508 "Ungh!"  
02_01509 "Almost… Almost… Gah!"  
02_01510 "No! Alyx, listen! The thing Russell and I found is some sort of… some sort of superweapon!"  
02_01511 "It's something big. They've got it here in the QZ in some kind of vault. But they're about to move it. Where, I don't know, but it's going to be soon."  
02_01512 "Yes! And look, look… I managed to pocket this Combine datapod. If I can decrypt it, we can figure out how to use their weapon against them."  
02_01513 "You head to the Vault. I'll take this thing back to Russell's and get to work."  
02_01514 "It's right in the middle of the QZ, and it's big. Get above ground and see what you can find."  
02_01515 "Go!"  
02_01517 "Yeah… I'm good."  
02_01600 "Gordon! Gordon! Wake up, Gordon!"  
02_01601 "She's gone, Gordon. She's GONE."  
02_01602 "Son of a bitch and his \"unforeseen consequences\"! I knew it. When I get my hands on him, I'm gonna… I'm gonna KILL him. I've got to figure this out. Right now…"  
02_01603 "\[Exhaling Deeply\]"  
02_01604 "Come on, Gordon."  
02_01605 "We've got work to do."  
02_01606 "I don't know, but …"  
02_01607 "You keep heading for the Vault. I'll poke around the datapod. See if I can figure something out."  
02_01608 "Alyx! I found something!"  
02_01609 "There's a Gravity Field Generator directly under the Vault. That's GOT to be what's keeping it up."  
02_01610 "Russell, stop her!"  
02_01611 "Alyx! Don't go in the V … \[Signal Cuts Out\]"  
02_01614 "Right there. That's the Gravity Field Generator."  
02_01615 "Russell! Goddamn, it's good to see you!"  
02_01616 "Alyx! Baby!"  
02_01619 "There it goes…"  
02_01621 "I'm working on it. Alyx, find a way in there. Go!"  
02_01702 "\[Groaning in Pain\]"  
02_01704 "Stay safe, baby. I love you."  
02_02000 "Prison…"  
02_02001 "It's not a vault. It's a prison. They didn't build it to keep us OUT. They're trying to keep something IN."  
02_02002 "The way I see it, whatever's in there doesn't like the Combine very much. So we've got THAT in common."  
02_02003 "So… Are we still doing this?"  
02_02004 "That's my girl. I'll let you know what I find out."  
02_02005 "Tell Alyx there's no way that backup is stable. She can shut it down."  
02_02006 "Goddamn it, Russ, they've got Gordon Freeman."  
02_02007 "This is very, VERY good."  
02_02008 "Damn right. We're gonna get Gordon Freeman back."  
02_02009 "Yeah, what's up, Alyx?"  
02_02010 "I don't know. But I bet it's a hell of a story."  
02_02011 "Alyx… You there?"  
02_02012 "It looks like you WILL be able to get into the Vault from up there. There's a terminal that extends a bridge to the entrance."  
02_02013 "I've got it all laid out in front of me and I'll tell you… There IS security, but I've never seen anything like it. It doesn't make any sense."  
02_02014 "Eh, don't worry, honey. I'll figure it out."  
02_02015 "You know, honey, you haven't been doing too bad yourself."  
02_02016 "Earth could've used you in the Seven Hour War."  
02_02017 "Alyx? Alyx! Alyx, are you okay?"  
02_02018 "I don't know. I'm not sure if this datapod even knows. But they got something trapped in there."  
02_02019 "I do. Russ, this thing's biocoded. I'm gonna need the TLI."  
02_02020 "Okay, great. You good, honey?"  
02_02021 "Keep that promise. I'll get to work on the datapod."  
02_02022 "I've got something."  
02_02023 "I don't know what the weapon is yet. But I DO know how they got it."  
02_02024 "It doesn't look like they actually built the weapon. It's like they… I don't know, discovered something. Or maybe they uncovered it."  
02_02025 "If I'm reading this right, they tracked it to an old apartment building in the QZ. But instead of going in to get it, they grabbed the whole building and built a vault around it."  
02_02026 "I'm trying to figure out whether WE oughta be."  
02_02030 "You can thank that Vortigaunt. He got me back here in one piece."  
02_02040 "Thank you… Thank you… Oh God…"  
02_03000 "\[Gasping for Breath\]"  
02_03001 "What is it, Russell?"  
02_03002 "Russell, let her think!"  
02_03004 "Good. Because when they move this thing, that weapon's gone. We need to get it tonight."
